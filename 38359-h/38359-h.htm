<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Every boy and girl&mdash;and, we might add, man
and woman&mdash;should collect stamps. Our reasons for
making this statement are many.</p>

<p>First, stamp-collecting is a highly fascinating pursuit,
which helps to while away countless pleasant hours.
On this score alone it is worth following.</p>

<p>Secondly, it encourages methodical habits. We
examine our stamps carefully, we discriminate between
the good and the bad specimens, we keep a
watch for minor varieties, we marshal our treasures in
correct order, and so on.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a vast amount of geography is learnt by
collecting. The stamps bring all sorts of out-of-the-way
countries to our notice, whilst the postmarks make
us conversant with various towns.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we get to know of hundreds of interesting
facts concerning the currency and language used in
every corner of the globe. The inscriptions on the
specimens teach us these matters.</p>

<p>Fifthly, stamp-collecting assists us to gain a real
knowledge of history. Ask any collector when Columbus
discovered America? Who was Prince Henry the
Navigator? Over what country did King Amadeus
reign? What form of government is possessed by
Paraguay? His answers will be far more intelligent
than those given by a non-collector.</p>

<p>But the foregoing are not the only matters which our
stamps teach us. What is the difference between an
engraving and a lithograph, between cream-laid paper
and wove paper, between magenta and cerise? These
and a thousand other questions the stamp collector can
answer correctly and without hesitation.</p>

<p>Surely a pastime which can help us to gain so much
valuable knowledge is worth the attention of every
boy and girl, as well as man and woman.</p>

<p class="center">PHILATELIC TERMS EXPLAINED</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adhesive.</span>&mdash;A stamp which is kept in position by
moistening the gummed under-surface. Most stamps
are adhesives. Postcards, envelopes, and wrappers which
have the stamp printed on them, are not adhesives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Block.</span>&mdash;A number of stamps not torn apart. A
strip of stamps and a number of stamps forming an
odd shape are, however, not considered as blocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalk-Surface.</span>&mdash;A surface given to stamps by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
means of a preparation of chalk, in order that obliterations
may not be cleaned out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Commemorative Stamps.</span>&mdash;Stamps issued to remind
people of bygone events.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Control Letters.</span>&mdash;Letters on the margin paper of
sheets of stamps, for official purposes of control.</p>

as it has passed or would pass through the post&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
not the stamp cut from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Error.</span>&mdash;A stamp which contains some faulty workmanship,
of whatever kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Facsimile.</span>&mdash;See Forgery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forgery.</span>&mdash;An unofficial stamp, one made in order
to cheat. In cases where a real stamp is given an
unauthorized overprint (which see), the stamp constitutes
a forgery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hinges.</span>&mdash;The papers gummed on one surface used
for fixing stamps to the album.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imperforate.</span>&mdash;Stamps that are not provided with
perforated margins to facilitate separation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Label.</span>&mdash;Another name for a stamp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Stamps.</span>&mdash;Stamps which are available for use
in some town or special area. There are none in England
at the present time. Russia and Morocco are
probably the only areas where they still exist, though
Switzerland, Turkey, Germany, China, and the United
States recognized them until within recent years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mint.</span>&mdash;A term applied to an unused stamp in
perfect condition, including the gum on the back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mounts.</span>&mdash;See Hinges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obliteration.</span>&mdash;Marks placed on a stamp by the

offices&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the obsolete Inland Revenue officials
of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Overprint.</span>&mdash;An inscription printed on the face of a
stamp to alter in some way its original use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perforated.</span>&mdash;A frame of small holes around a stamp
made in order to facilitate separation from its neighbour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perforation, Compound.</span>&mdash;Exists when the holes
are not of the same size and distance apart around the
four sides of a stamp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perforation Gauge.</span>&mdash;An instrument for measuring
the perforations of a stamp. Usual cost about 6d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philatelist.</span>&mdash;Not merely a stamp collector, but
one who "loves" (&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;=a lover) his stamps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate Numbers.</span>&mdash;Usually spoken of in connection
with the line-engraved stamps of Great Britain. They
serve to indicate the plate from which any particular
stamp was printed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Provisionals.</span>&mdash;Stamps which are intended for temporary
use whilst a permanent issue is being prepared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remainders.</span>&mdash;Genuine stamps left over after the
particular issue has become obsolete. There is no
objection to remainders as there is to reprints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reprints.</span>&mdash;Stamps printed from dies after they have
become obsolete. Many countries sell their obsolete
dies, with the result that more or less inaccurate reprints
are made from them. Reprints, for philatelic purposes,
should be classed with forgeries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rouletted.</span>&mdash;The presence of a frame of small slits
around a stamp in order to facilitate separation from
its neighbour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speculative Stamps.</span>&mdash;Postage stamps issued by an
unscrupulous Government for philatelic, rather than
postal, purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strip of Stamps.</span>&mdash;A row of stamps joined together
(compare Block).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surcharge.</span>&mdash;An overprint placed on a stamp to
alter its face value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Variety.</span>&mdash;A term to describe a stamp that differs

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">HOW TO FORM A STAMP COLLECTION</p>

<p>Most philatelists drift into stamp-collecting&mdash;that is
to say, the start is made unconsciously, and without any
definite planning. Probably the first specimens are
obtained through the generosity of a friend who
possesses a few duplicates, or may be the letters coming
regularly from a relative living in some remote part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the world supply the earliest treasures. But however
the beginning is made, progress will be slow unless
friends are very generous or a little money is spent on
buying sufficient specimens to make a fair start. In the
ordinary course, the collector will be wise if he spends a
few shillings on buying a packet of the commoner
stamps which form the basis of all collections.</p>

<p>The packet should cost as much as the beginner can
reasonably afford, and be composed of different stamps&mdash;that
is to say, without containing any duplicates. If
four or five shillings are to be invested, as many as four
hundred varieties may be expected, whilst a thousand
varieties will usually cost about half a guinea.</p>

<p>Armed with such a nucleus as this, the fascinations of
the pastime begin to make themselves evident. Duplicates
will quickly accumulate, and serve to form the
basis of exchanges amongst friends. Approval sheets
will invariably come to hand from dealers, and permit
of additional specimens being secured at a very cheap
rate; whilst attractive bargains will be obtained, from
time to time, through the medium of advertisements in
newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>But the reader may argue that stamp-collecting is a
costly pastime if every specimen must be bought. In
practice it is anything but an expensive hobby. If the
writer were to sell his collection, he would obtain about
three or four times the amount he spent on forming it.
The reason for this lies in the fact that stamps seldom
lose their value, but frequently rise in price.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>When a hundred or more varieties have accumulated,
an album should be procured. These may be obtained
at all prices and in a bewildering variety of patterns.
Too often the young philatelist provides himself with a
voluminous album in which his tiny but growing collection
appears as a drop of water in the ocean. It is far
better to buy a small, cheap album which may serve as a
temporary home until the treasures have grown sufficiently
numerous to warrant a more expensive one.</p>

<p>Many collectors prefer to house their stamps in a
scrap-book containing a number of fairly stout, smooth,
blank leaves. In such a book as this we are free to
arrange the stamps just as fancy dictates; we can place
them close together or far apart, and we can reserve as
many or as few pages as seems desirable for each individual
country. The writer's collection is contained in
two books of this description. Great Britain fills the
first fifteen pages, and the Colonies follow in alphabetical
order in the first volume. In the second volume the
foreign countries are set out in the order in which their
Governments first issued stamps&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Brazil comes
first, then the United States, then France, Belgium,
Bavaria, Spain, etc. This is, of course, a somewhat
unusual plan to follow, but it certainly has advantages.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking of albums, it will be well to point
out that stamps should never be fixed to more than one
side of a page. If both faces are used, the stamps will
rub against each other and also catch one with another.</p>

<p>Before the specimens are placed in the album, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
should be carefully examined, and cleaned, if necessary.
When paper is adhering to the backs, it should be
removed. This unsticking process is easily performed
when the specimen is immersed in a bowl of hot water,
but, unfortunately, many stamps will be utterly ruined
if even a trace of moisture is allowed to come in contact
with their colours. No rule can be given as to which
stamps spoil and which do not when treated with a hot
bath, but it is safe to say that valuable specimens suffer
considerably, whilst common varieties emerge from the
ordeal unscathed. Perhaps this is just a matter of
natural contrariness.</p>

<p>To be on the safe side, however, no stamp should
be plunged into hot water. Cheap varieties may well
be floated on the surface of warm water, but the rarer
kinds must not be subjected to even this treatment;
they should be placed face upwards on a sheet of wet
blotting-paper, and left until the adhering paper can be
peeled off without an effort. After the under-surface
of a stamp has been cleaned, it should be pressed between
two sheets of dry blotting-paper and carefully dried. If
it seems liable to cockle or is creased in any way, it is
a good plan to flatten it out by means of a warm, though
not hot, iron, the stamp being protected by three or
four thicknesses of white blotting-paper.</p>

<p>Fixing the stamps to the album is the next operation.
On no account should the under-surface be gummed
all over and the whole stamp stuck down to the page
of the hook. The collection will need constant re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>arranging,
certain specimens will have to make way for
more perfect copies, and so on; this will be quite impossible
unless hinges are used. These contrivances are
thin but tough pieces of paper, approximately one by
three-quarters of an inch in size, and gummed on one
surface. They cost about sixpence per thousand.</p>

<p>When a stamp is to be fixed to the album, a gummed
strip is taken and folded so that the adhesive side is
turned outwards; one flap is then moistened and stuck
to the stamp and the other is moistened and stuck to
the page. The specimen is thus hinged to the album
in such a way that its underside can be inspected easily&mdash;a
necessary matter when the watermark or the quality
of the paper requires examination. The hinge should be
fastened as high up on the back of the stamp as possible,
but not so high that it touches the perforated edge.</p>

<p>One little point needs mention. On no account
should cheap hinges be used or hinges made at home
and fixed with ordinary gum. Unless the adhesive is
entirely free from acid&mdash;and ordinary or cheap gum is
not&mdash;the stamps will become discoloured and entirely
ruined. The writer laments to this day a fine set of
old Queenslands which he fixed, many years ago, by
means of some cheap and nasty hinges. The stamps
grow more and more discoloured as time wears on,
but the exasperating thing is that good copies of these
Australian treasures are now worth almost as many
pounds as they were pence in the days when the
offending gum was applied to their under-surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Some method must be adopted for the arrangement
of the stamps in the album. Beginners are apt to fix
the specimens in no particular order, merely one after
the other as they come into their possession; but this
is clearly a wrong plan to follow. Either of the following
methods is worth adopting:</p>

<p>1. Sort out the stamps of each country according to
the prices printed on them, and then stick all the specimens
of one value together, but in order of age.</p>

<p>2. Sort out the stamps of each country according to
their issues; then arrange each set in the album, in
ascending order of the values.</p>

<p>To follow either of these plans, we must know the
date of issue of all our specimens. This, of course,
requires a certain amount of knowledge, but information
of such a kind comes with marvellous rapidity
when once the collector's interest has become fully
aroused. As a guide, however, a catalogue such as
the one published by Messrs. Stanley Gibbons, Ltd.,
should be procured. The colour, pattern, watermark,
approximate market value and date of issue of every
postage stamp may then be learnt with certainty.</p>

<p>We must guard against cramping the specimens too
closely together. In order that our collection may
grow naturally, space must be left for additions which
may reasonably be expected to fall into our possession.
Every distinct issue should be started on a fresh line,
and room must be allowed at the end of a country for
future issues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the stamps which ought and which ought not
to be admitted into the album, a great deal could be
written. In the first case, it is well to rule out every
specimen which is not perfect in every detail. Torn
stamps are almost worthless&mdash;even though they may
be copies of rarities&mdash;and on no account should a place
be found for them in the collection. There is no need
to throw them away or get rid of them; they might
well be allotted a home in a minor album. Not only
torn stamps, but copies which have lost two or three
teeth of the perforated edge, copies which have been
heavily postmarked, copies which are dirty or discoloured,
and copies which have served for revenue
and not for postal purposes&mdash;all these should be kept
out of the collection.</p>

<p>Concerning the stamps which have been cut out of
entires&mdash;that is to say, from postcards, letter-cards,
wrappers, and impressed envelopes&mdash;a difference of
opinion exists among experts. Some say that they
ought not to be included, whilst others urge their
inclusion. Without a doubt, these stamps are interesting;
and as they serve for purely postal uses, there
seems no reason why they should not be allowed a
home in the collection. Perhaps the collector should
be advised not to seek after specimens of this nature,
but that is quite another thing to excluding them
rigorously.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of stamps which do not serve
for franking letters in the usual way, but as their func<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tions
are purely postal, a position in the album should
be awarded them. Among such stamps as these may
be mentioned the "Postage Due" issue which Great
Britain put into use early in 1914. These labels serve
the purpose of indicating and at the same time checking
the fees which are levied on letters and parcels that
have been insufficiently prepaid. It is interesting to
note, that though our authorities have only issued
stamps of this nature recently, foreign countries have
used them for close on half a century. Such stamps
from abroad may be recognized by the inscriptions
which they bear&mdash;"A Percevoir," "A Payer," "Te
Betalen," "Deficit," "Segnatasse," "Too Late," etc.</p>

<p>Another kind of stamp which should be accepted is
the "Parcels Post" label. Though we at home have
no special labels for this particular service, many Continental
countries use them, notably Belgium and the
United States. Then there are the "Express Delivery"
stamps of the United States, Canada, Italy, etc. The
purpose of these labels is sufficiently explained by the
wording on the United States stamp: "Secures Immediate
Delivery at any Post Office." A fourth stamp of special
usage is the newspaper stamp. Though many of our
home railways employ these labels, there are no Governmental
varieties. Abroad, however, we find a number
of countries use them&mdash;the newspaper stamps of
Hungary and Spain being fairly common.</p>

<p>There is one kind of postage stamp, however, that
should not be extended a welcome in the usual way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&mdash;we
have in mind the specimens known as "local"
stamps. These special labels&mdash;they are mostly obsolete&mdash;came
chiefly from Germany, Russia, Switzerland, and
China, and were used by private companies which possessed
certain postal privileges. As a rule the
operations of these bodies were carried out in small
areas (hence "local" stamps), usually in out-of-the-way
districts where the ordinary postal arrangements did not
penetrate. Genuine obliterated stamps of this class
possess a certain amount of interest, and in some cases
command high prices; but as there were so many
varieties, and as it is difficult to discriminate between
the genuine and the fictitious, collectors are well advised
to leave them all alone. Undoubtedly a number of the
carrying companies went on printing and selling their
stamps to collectors long after the postal rights were
taken from them. This fact alone should make the
cautious philatelist hesitate before purchasing specimens
known as "locals."</p>

<p>More dangerous than the "locals" are the commemorative
stamps which certain impecunious Governments
issue with the idea of attracting philatelists.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These
stamps invariably bear exquisite designs, and are usually
current for a limited period. Their appearance is
heralded with much beating of drums, and the idea is
carefully spread abroad that only the earliest purchasers
will be able to secure copies. As a rule these labels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
printed in millions, and are often sold to large buyers
under face value. The proceeds go towards making
the country solvent, or in providing for palatial postal
headquarters. Of course, such stamps can hardly be
considered postage stamps, as the number used for
postal service is but a minute fraction of the whole
issue. It is on these grounds that the wise collector
should refuse to treasure up labels, the main purpose
of which is to amass money for an unscrupulous
Government.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Some commemorative stamps are, of course, issued in a purely
legitimate way, and must not be confused with the above.</p></div>

<p>The objection to commemorative, or perhaps it would
be better to say speculative, stamps disappears in cases
where the specimens have been through the post. Such
labels have franked letters or parcels, and have thus
fulfilled the conditions which we demand of genuine
used stamps. Unfortunately, this fact has been noted
by at least one Government, and in order that its gaudy
labels should not be shunned by the collector, it has
had some thousands of unused copies specially cancelled
in the hope that the obliterations will serve to make
them more acceptable. Undoubtedly some of the
stamps marked in this way are very attractive; but, of
course, they are not postage stamps in any sense, and
can thus make no appeal to the philatelist.</p>

<p>A third group of undesirable stamps comes from
South America. About thirty years ago a Mr. Seebeck,
of New York, entered into an agreement with Ecuador,
Honduras, Salvador, and Nicaragua, to supply each of
these republics with new stamp-dies once a year on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
condition that the old dies should be handed to him as
they fell out of use. As soon as a set of dies became
superseded, he printed from the plates and flooded the
market with unused copies. The Seebeck issues, needless
to say, are of little interest.</p>

<p>Seebeck is not the only man who has printed from
discarded dies; there are, in fact, many types of stamps
on the market which have been produced from obsolete
plates. Such stamps are known as "reprints," and are
worthless except as curiosities. Perhaps the best-known
reprints are those bearing the inscription "Heligoland";
but as these labels emanate from the Government printing
works at Berlin, and have never been to this little
island, it is clear that they have served no genuine postal
purpose.</p>

<p>Reprints are difficult to distinguish from the original
stamps, but as a rule slight differences in colour prove
sufficient clues to their identity. Often the correct
kind of paper and watermark are unobtainable by those
who print them, and then the merest novice may detect
their origin with the aid of a catalogue.</p>

<p>There are so many undesirable stamps to be found
on the market in an unused condition that the beginner
may feel that the safest plan will be to confine his attentions
to obliterated varieties alone. There is much
reason in such an argument, but it is not altogether a
wise course to follow. Unused specimens, as long as
they are issued for genuine postal purposes by reputable
countries, are more sought after than those which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
been obliterated, and their value is more likely to rise
in the future.</p>

<p>One matter which often puzzles the novice is how
to decide whether two particular stamps are similar or
different. If there is the slightest variation in&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
Design; (<i>b</i>) method employed of printing; (<i>c</i>) colour;
(<i>d</i>) method employed for separating the individual
stamps; (<i>e</i>) texture of paper; (<i>f</i>) watermark&mdash;then
the two stamps may be looked upon as being different,
and both should be placed in the album. Certain
stamps bear designs on their reverse side&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
horn on early issues of Sweden. Copies both with
and without the design should be added to the
collection. The addition of advertising matter on
the reverse side (see New Zealand issues), however,
does not constitute a difference. In the case of recent
Belgian stamps which bear the inscription, "Not to
be delivered on Sunday," in both French and Flemish,
specimens with and without the label should not both
be given a home in the collection. Lastly, it may
be well to point out that stamps, on paper of various
textures, which have been cut from entires, should not
be considered as individual varieties, seeing that most
Governments are prepared to impress any letters, cards,
etc., that may be supplied to them, and varieties of
such stamps must be, on this account, unlimited.</p>

<p>When the collector has amassed a number of good
duplicates, it will be a wise plan for him to join one
of the many exchange clubs. In this way he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
able to turn his surplus stamps into specimens for the
collection. The working of these organizations is
simple. Each member sends a sheet of his own
stamps, with prices marked on them, to the secretary
of the club, who places them all in a portfolio which
is forwarded to each member in turn. When a
member receives the portfolio, he selects specimens at
will from any of the sheets, but he generally endeavours
to balance his own takings with the takings of all the
members from his sheet.</p>

</div>

<p>Another and perhaps better way of enriching one's
collection is open to the philatelist who is able to
obtain quantities of the medium class British and
Colonial stamps. Briefly, the method is to insert an
advertisement in a journal, which enjoys an overseas
circulation, to the effect that for every hundred stamps
sent of the reader's country, a hundred or more well-mixed
British and Colonials will be despatched by the
advertiser in return. The writer used to make it a
practice of inserting some such notice as this two or
three times every season, and the plan invariably
brought in many valuable additions to his collection.
Suitable mediums are the <i>Overseas Daily Mail</i>, the
<i>Boy's Own Paper</i> (in the Boy's Own Column), <i>The
Philatelic Journal of America</i>, and <i>L'Écho de la
Timbrologie</i>.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, it may be well to give
some hints on how to value one's collection. Possessed
of a stamp catalogue, the philatelist can easily jot down
the price of every stamp in his album, and so arrive at
the total catalogue value. But this figure will be
much above the price a dealer would give for the
treasures. The catalogue value of a stamp is the
selling price. What we want to know is the buying
price&mdash;a very different matter.</p>

<p>To get an approximate idea of the value which a
collection would realize, we should calculate as follows:</p>

<p>1. Nothing for all stamps catalogued at 1d. or 2d.</p>

<p>2. One penny each for stamps marked 3d. or 4d. each.</p>

<p>3. Three-halfpence to twopence each for stamps
marked 5d. to 8d.</p>

<p>4. Quarter catalogue value for stamps quoted between
9d. and 4s.</p>

<p>5. Half catalogue value for other stamps, except for
rarities, which often command full catalogue figures.</p>

<p>None but first-class specimens, and, in the case of
used stamps, only those which have served postally,
should be taken into consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">SPECIALIZING</p>

<p>As a rule it takes but a few months for the young
collector to discover that he much prefers the stamps
of one particular country, or group of countries, to any
of the others figuring in his album. When such a
preference manifests itself, it is a good plan to specialize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in the favoured country or group. By this we do not
mean to say that the general collection should be discontinued,
or even neglected, but merely that special
attention be given to the stamps which have made the
greater appeal to the philatelist.</p>

<p>Some countries are better suited to specializing than
others. Undoubtedly Great Britain holds the premier
position. Not only does it stand first from patriotic
motives, but the plate numbers and plate letters which
the earlier issues bore, the control letters which later
issues bear, and the colour varieties known to exist
amongst certain of the current values, all help to make
it a country full of interest.</p>

<p>Among the Colonies there is much scope for the
specialist, notably in Queensland, South Australia,
India&mdash;if the Native States be excepted&mdash;Canada, including
the specimens issued by the various provinces
prior to 1864, and the Transvaal.</p>

<p>In other parts of the world we may single out the
United States, Portugal, the Argentine Republic, the
Spanish Colonies, together with the subsequent occupation
of certain of them by the United States, and the
French Colonies. Of the latter only used specimens
should be collected, as unused copies of any of the
Dependencies may be bought at face value in Paris&mdash;a
matter which largely robs the labels of their interest.</p>

<p>But the specialist need not necessarily confine himself
to a country, or even a group of countries. In this
connection the following divisions may be suggested:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Stamps issued owing to wars.</p>

<p>2. Edwardian stamps.</p>

<p>3. Parcels post stamps.</p>

<p>4. Commemorative stamps, as long as they are not
issued for speculative purposes.</p>

<p>5. The line-engraved stamps of Great Britain (see
following chapter).</p>

<p>Just as certain countries or groups present exceptional
chances for specializing, so others offer but poor
opportunities. In cases where the issues are few, or
where the stamps are high priced, the path of the
specialist is beset with difficulties, and should not be
followed.</p>

<p>The first need of the collector who intends to pay particular
attention to an individual group of stamps is a
blank album containing about two dozen pages. Into
this volume should be gathered the specimens bearing
on the chosen section as they are obtained. Less
formality and regularity will be called for when placing
the stamps in this book than was demanded in the
general collection; in other words, the stamps need
not be ranged so precisely according to age and value.
Whatever method is adopted should be used rather for
contrasting and comparing minor details than for showing
complete issues. In the stamps of Great Britain,
for instance, we should not place, say, the Edwardian
issue in two or three methodical rows, the halfpenny
first, followed by the penny, then the three-halfpenny,
and so on, up to the one pound. We should group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
together the varieties of, say, the threepenny, which
include such shades as purple on yellow, purple on
lemon, deep purple on lemon, dull purple on yellow,
and which are found perforated 14, also 15 by 14.
When placed side by side, these various shades and
perforations will show up clearly; but if scattered over
two or three pages of the album, their meaning will be
lost entirely.</p>

<p>It is clear that the specialist must know a good deal
more about his stamps than was demanded of the
general collector. In the first place, he must be able
to distinguish one form of printing from another.
For his benefit it may be well to mention that the
chief processes employed in printing stamps are
(1) Typography, (2) Lithography, and (3) Engraving.</p>

<p>Typography, or surface-printing, is the process employed
in the production of our current British stamps.
A die is cut with the design standing out in relief&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the portions which are to receive the ink are raised.
From this die a number of identical moulds are taken
and ranged side by side. They are then clamped
together and placed in an electro bath which deposits
a layer of copper upon the moulds. When the coating
is deemed sufficiently thick, the electrical action is
arrested, the moulds are removed, and the copper
plate reveals a number of replicas of the original die.</p>

<p>Lithography is a process which results from etching
on stone. A piece of stone possessing a flat surface is
taken, and the design drawn in ink upon it either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
hand or some mechanical means. The surface of the
stone is then flooded with a weak acid, which eats away
the unprotected parts, but leaves untouched the parts
covered by the greasy lithograph ink. The stone is
then sponged with water, and printer's ink, also greasy,
applied. This latter adheres only to the lines made by
the lithographic process, with the result that impressions
of the design may be transferred to paper. Lithography,
it should be added, is only suitable in cases where comparatively
few copies are needed, or where a temporary
issue must be printed expeditiously. It is a process
which demands but little capital outlay, a fact which
has made it a favourite means of stamp-producing
among the poorer republics of South America. With
forgers, too, it has gained favour in their work of
imitating genuine stamps.</p>

<p>Engraving, known variously under the name of
copper-plate printing, engraving in <i>taille-douce</i>, and
line-engraving, produces the finest stamps figuring
in our collections. The process is worked much on
the lines detailed for typography, but the main difference
is that in the latter the design is printed by
the raised parts of the block, whilst in the former the
recessed parts produce the lines which form the design.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the following occasional
methods of producing stamps may be registered:</p>

<p>1. By the use of ordinary printer's type. (Examples
may be found among the earliest issues, as in
the case of the first stamps of British Guiana.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>2. By photographic means. (Example&mdash;the Mafeking
stamps bearing the head of Baden-Powell.)</p>

<p>3. By means of rubber hand-stamps. (Example&mdash;first
issue of New Republic, South Africa.)</p>

<p>4. Embossing. (Example&mdash;the current British
stamped penny and halfpenny envelopes.)</p>

<p>After the various styles of printing have been recognized,
the specialist must study the papers used in
stamp-production. The chief varieties are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Wove.</span>&mdash;This paper possesses no patterns of any
kind, but under the microscope appears to have a
number of porous marks. It is used for the current
British stamps.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Granite.</span>&mdash;A variety of wove, used fairly frequently.
It may be distinguished by the short, tiny,
coloured hairs which are impressed upon the paper.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Laid.</span>&mdash;This paper possesses a number of parallel
ribs, which can only be seen when the stamp is held up
to the light.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Quadrilled.</span>&mdash;A paper bearing vertical and horizontal
watermark lines of a somewhat obvious character.</p>

<p>The various methods used for separating stamps is
the next matter for study. In the earliest times postmasters
used ordinary scissors for detaching one stamp
from another. The specimens so treated are styled
"imperforate." The use of scissors was clearly an
awkward way of performing what is now a simple
matter, and it is well known that from the outset the
need for a more expeditious method was felt. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
consequence many people gave the question of stamp-separating
their attention, with the result that, eight
years after the advent of the first postage adhesive,
Henry Archer patented the rouletting machine, which
cut slits along the margins of the stamps. The slits
served the same purpose as the perforation holes in the
stamps of to-day, but the drawback to this pioneer
method was that in pulling one copy from another the
labels were likely to become torn. Between 1848 and
1854 Archer tried many systems for separating stamps,
and, in the latter year, perfected a machine for perforating
instead of rouletting the margins of adhesives.</p>

<p>Most stamps are now described as "perf. 13, 14, or
15," which means that within the space of 2 centimetres
a specimen contains 13, 14, or 15 holes. A
stamp catalogued as "perf. 15 X 14"&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, British fourpenny
bright orange, Edward issue&mdash;has fifteen holes
per 2 centimetres along the top and bottom edges,
and fourteen holes along either side. As a difference
of perforation often makes a considerable difference in
the market value of a stamp, every philatelist should
possess a gauge for measuring the holes; these are
obtainable from dealers at a cost of sixpence each.</p>

<p>We said at the commencement of this chapter that
Great Britain offered the greatest opportunities to the
specialist. Let us now see how the stamps of our own
country should be treated in a specialized collection.
First of all, it should be the aim of the philatelist to
procure not merely one specimen of any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
label, but specimens in pairs and in blocks of four or
more. Individual copies of the early penny black are
worth about two shillings, but four copies in one block
would fetch as much as ten to twelve shillings; also a
fine copy on a postal wrapper would be much more
valuable than a loose specimen. The moral, therefore,
is clear: we should never separate costly stamps nor
tear them from their envelopes. Young collectors
seem to dislike the plan of admitting entire envelopes
to their albums, but this is a prejudice which should be
overcome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

</span>
</div>

<p>An ideal first page for a special collection of British
stamps would show a whole wrapper bearing a nice
copy of the penny black, then the individual stamp in
pairs or blocks, followed by a somewhat similar arrangement
affecting the sister stamp&mdash;the twopenny blue.</p>

<p>The page should not be crowded with specimens,
but much space ought to be given up to explanatory
written matter. At the head of the page, for instance,
the following might be neatly printed: "Line-Engraved
Stamps. Issued May 1st, 1840." Elsewhere
room might be found for the statement that the adhesives
given on the page were engraved by Mr. Frederick
Heath, and printed by the famous firm of Perkins,
Bacon and Co.; whilst below each stamp the particular
watermark, paper, and method of separation
should be mentioned. Nor should the notes end here;
any little piece of postal information which may be
discovered should be added to swell the interest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the collection. As an example of such matter, we may
quote the following recipe for making red obliterating
ink, which was sent to every postmaster in the kingdom
when the penny black was first issued:</p>

<p>
Take 1 lb. printer's red ink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">1 pint linseed oil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">1/2 pint of the droppings of sweet oil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And well mix.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Another early stamp which will well repay attention
is the perforated penny red with control letters in the
four corners. This specimen bears various plate numbers,
from 71 to 225 (Nos. 75, 77,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> 126, 128 excepted).
The collector will do well to seek out a copy of each
number and arrange them in numerical order on three or
four pages of the album. The distinctive numbers are
to be found on either side of the head, hidden among
the filigree lines. No. 225, it may be said, is somewhat
difficult to obtain, but all the others are fairly common.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Plate No. 77 is supposed to have been rejected as unfit for use.
An unused copy, however, figures in the Tapling Collection in the
British Museum.</p></div>

<p>"Plate reconstructing" is another favourite work
of the specialist. Let us first explain that many of the
early British stamps contained various letters in the
four corners. In a sheet of 240 stamps, the specimens
found in the first row were all lettered A, in the lower
left-hand corner, those in the second row B, in the
third row C, and so on throughout the twenty rows.
In the right-hand lower corner the first stamp of
every row was lettered A, the second B, and so on until
the twelfth stamp bore the letter L. The following
diagram will make the arrangement quite clear:</p>

<p>The work of plate reconstructing consists in obtaining
one stamp of each of the combinations of letters,
placing them in their correct positions as given above,
and so remaking a whole sheet of stamps.</p>

<p>Such is the way in which a specialist's collection
should be managed. Our remarks have been directed
more particularly to the stamps of Great Britain, but
the suggestions apply equally well to any country which
the philatelist may select for particular study.</p>

<p class="center">THE STAMPS OF GREAT BRITAIN</p>

<p>So far these talks have dealt almost entirely with
ways and means of stamp-collecting, but now our attention
must be centred on the stamps themselves. We
naturally turn to the issues of Great Britain, the
first specimen to be considered being the "penny
black," bearing a portrait in profile of Victoria the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Good. Not only was this stamp the first to be issued
within our kingdom, but it was also the pioneer stamp,
of the whole world. It is thus one of the most interesting
labels which can figure among the treasures of
any collection.</p>

<p>To Sir Rowland Hill, the promoter of the penny
postage and other postal reforms, belongs the credit
of first suggesting that the postage on a letter should
be prepared by means of an adhesive label. Not only
may he be called the inventor of postage stamps, but
he also sketched in rough the design which was used
for the first stamp. To him, also, was entrusted the
work of arranging for the issue of this novel label.</p>

<p>On August 17, 1839, Parliament sanctioned the
use of adhesive stamps, and immediately afterwards
the Lords of the Treasury asked the public to suggest
suitable designs. Nearly 3,000 drawings were submitted,
but none were considered satisfactory. It
was then that Hill made the rough sketch mentioned
above.</p>

<p>Many were the difficulties which Hill had to overcome,
but probably the most perplexing was how to
get the stamps printed. We must remember that in
those early days colour-printing was a slow and tedious
process, and there were very few firms who could be
entrusted with the work. After much consideration,
Sir Rowland went to a Fleet Street house of printers
named Perkins, Bacon and Co., and asked them whether
they could undertake the task of producing the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
adhesive stamps. Their reply is sufficiently interesting
to be given in full.</p>

<p>"We have given the subject you mentioned
yesterday afternoon all the attention the time would
allow, and beg to say as the result that we would
engrave steel dies of the size you gave us, containing
work of any conceivable value as to cost and quality,
transfer them to any number of plates that could possibly
be wanted, and print them in any numbers per
day, at a charge of eightpence per thousand stamps,
exclusive of paper, which, we understand, would be
supplied us; and, assuming that the numbers wanted
would be very large, we have only named a fair price
for the printing, and have considered the plates and
dies, which ought to be very costly in the first instance,
as given in without charge. You are probably aware
that, having prepared the original die, we could insure
perfect 'facsimiles' of it for a century.</p>

<p>"Our charge would not exceed what we have named
above, nor be less than sixpence per thousand; but
what relative position it would take between these two
extremes would depend upon the exact size of the
stamp, and the number which the paper would allow us
to put upon one plate.</p>

<p>"We could prepare everything so as to commence
printing in a month. Our present belief is that we could
print 41,600 labels per day, or double that number in a
day and night, from each press employed upon the work.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are, sir, very respectfully,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your humble servants,<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The Perkins' firm was entrusted with the printing;
instructions were also given them to elaborate the
rough sketch made by Hill. They called upon a then
noted engraver, Frederick Heath, to complete the
design which has since become world-famous. He
engraved the head and the lettering, but the beautiful
curves forming the background of the stamp were
"engine-turned" by means of a Rose engine, a contrivance
consisting of a series of moving wheels which
produced curved lines in geometric pattern.</p>

<p>The stamp proved a great success, thanks to the
energies of Hill and the assistance of the printers; but
it had one great fault&mdash;it was printed with a fast ink,
which enabled dishonest people to wash out the obliterations
and use the cleaned copies a second time. As
a result, the black specimens were superseded in less
than nine months by red ones printed with a fugitive
ink. The short life of the first stamp has, of course,
much to do with its present high price.</p>

<p>The dies used for the black impressions were employed
for the red pennies, so that the two stamps are
identical in all respects but colour. Gradually, as years
passed along, slight changes were introduced. First,
the small check letters in the lower angles were substituted
by large letters, then perforated edges were
provided, whilst in 1854 the whole of the dies were
re-engraved. Stamps printed from the old and the new
plates may be distinguished fairly easily. In die I.
the nose is straight, there is little shading around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
eye, and the lobe of the ear terminates with an upward
curl. In die II the nose is slightly rounded, the eye
is surrounded by much shading, and the lobe of the ear
finishes without any upward curl.</p>

<p>The black and red penny stamps were line engraved
(<i>cf</i>. previous chapter). The only other stamps printed
in this style were the twopenny blue, issued concurrently
with the penny black; the halfpenny rose; and
the three-halfpenny red rose, both issued on October 1,
1870.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat remarkable, in these days when
we have thirteen different stamps of values lower than
a shilling, that in the early years the country was able
to carry on its postal arrangements with but a penny
and a twopenny stamp. That there was need for
specimens of higher value seems certain, as the inland
registration fee was a shilling, and the postal rates abroad
were surprisingly high. In 1847 the letter rate for the
United States was lowered to a shilling, and for France
to tenpence; consequently, the time seemed appropriate
for introducing three new stamps&mdash;a shilling, a tenpenny,
and a sixpenny.</p>

<p>Though the line-engraved stamps had proved extremely
satisfactory, there were certain high officials
who claimed that these labels were by no means proof
against dishonest practices. It was partly to please
these dissentients that the three new values bore the
familiar head of Queen Victoria in cameo relief. The
innovation was almost if not a complete bar to forgery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
also to the removal of obliterations by people of questionable
character; but it made printing a slow and
expensive process. Hitherto a sheet of stamps had
been printed by one movement of the machine, but
every embossed stamp needed a separate pressing.
There were twenty-four stamps of these three new
values on a sheet, which meant that instead of one action
completing the sheet, twenty-four actions were required.</p>

<p>Some of these old stamps are to be found with the
impression of another partly overlapping; this is due
to the fact that the machines were fed by hand, and
unless the workman placed the paper in exact position
one stamp was bound to fall partly on to its neighbour.</p>

<p>One curious feature of the tenpenny and shilling
stamps must be mentioned. Into the paper on which
these adhesives were printed was introduced a number
of silk threads in such a way that each stamp bore two
portions of the thread. The silken lines ran either
horizontally or vertically across each specimen, and
made counterfeiting an almost impossible task. The
sixpenny value was provided with a watermark as a
safeguard.</p>

<p>The cameo stamps gained but little popularity, and
were current less than ten years. Of the sixpenny
specimen, we know that 6,659,920 copies were printed,
and of them, 2,941,640 were destroyed after their
withdrawal, probably about as many copies as are sold
of our current penny stamps on an ordinary weekday.</p>

<p>On July 31, 1855, a fourpenny stamp was introduced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
It was produced neither by the line-engraved process
nor by the embossing method. A system of typography,
or surface-printing (see p. 21), had long been used
on the Continent, and it was this process which
was employed for the printing of the new fourpenny
value. Messrs. De La Rue and Co. were entrusted
with the work.</p>

<p>The fourpenny surface-printed stamp proved very
successful, and was followed by other values&mdash;the
shilling green, the threepenny rose, the sixpenny lilac,
and the ninepenny straw colour. Many of these early
stamps bore minor distinguishing marks, and consequently
command high prices. A very dark shade of the
shilling green is worth £65 in an unused condition, the
threepenny rose, with a white dot on either side of the
word "Postage," has changed hands for £40, whilst
the ninepenny straw colour, with a fine white line
drawn across the exterior angles of the square spaces
for the corner letters, is catalogued as high as £30.
Specimens of these values should be carefully examined
to see if they happen to be the rare kinds.</p>

<p>The surface-printed stamps issued between 1862 and
1881 bore angular check letters as well as plate numbers,
and therefore prove of exceptional interest to those of
us who wish to specialize in the stamps of our own
Kingdom. Unused copies should be carefully preserved
with the original gum on the backs, as their prices
advance with every season. The used copies, also,
prove a good investment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1881 (July 12) the well-known penny lilac, with
a large head of Victoria, was issued, and continued in
use until the accession of King Edward. The stamps
sold during the first five months had fourteen white
dots in each corner, but afterwards the number, for
some unaccountable reason, was increased to sixteen.
The early variety, needless to say, commands a much
greater price than the later one. The two stamps are
easily confused, but a careful examination of our copies
will soon tell us whether each used specimen is worth a
fraction of a farthing or a sixpenny piece. Some time
after the accession of King Edward the writer went into
a post office and bought two dozen penny stamps. The
clerk who served him half apologized for still selling
the old specimens bearing the Queen's head. On
reaching home, however, the adhesives were carefully
examined, and found to be the rare "fourteen dot"
variety, worth, unused, about four shillings apiece. It
is hardly necessary to add that the block, intact, has
found a home in the writer's collection.</p>

<p>The next stamps to attract attention are those of
King Edward. At first sight there appears to be one
variety of each value, with the exception of the halfpenny
and the fourpenny, which are both found in two
obvious varieties. On closer examination, however, the
Edwardian stamps will be found to possess many minor
but interesting differences. In the first case, most of
the values were printed in turn by the firm of De La
Rue, by Harrison and Son, also by the Government at
Somerset House, and each set of impressions shows
marked variations in colour. The most interesting
Edwardian differences, however, are due to varieties of
paper. In 1905 the authorities came to the conclusion
that the then current stamps were not sufficiently protective
against fraud. It was easy enough, they said, to
compound an obliteration ink for use in the post offices
which could not be cleaned away; but, as postage stamps
were also used in increasing numbers for revenue purposes,
it was also necessary to make the stamps of such
colours that they could not be cleaned of even ordinary
writing-ink. As a consequence, the labels on the usual
paper were gradually superseded by specimens printed
on a specially prepared "chalk-surface" paper. When
this paper is wetted, the chalky glaze breaks up, and the
coloured design is ruined. This innovation provides a
complete check to the practices of fraudulent "stamp
cleaners," but makes it almost impossible for collectors
to remove the paper backing which disfigures many of
their treasures.</p>

<p>"The easiest way to find out whether a stamp is
printed on ordinary unsurfaced or on chalk-surfaced
paper," says Mr. F. J. Melville in "King Edward VII.
Stamps," "is to draw a small silver coin across one of
the perforations or a piece of the marginal paper adhering
to the stamp. If a black line appears where the
silver has touched the paper, it indicates a chalk surface."</p>

<p>A third minor variety of the Edwardian stamps must
be recorded. In certain of the halfpenny and penny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
values the large crown watermark is found inverted.
Such specimens were not, as might be expected, the
result of faulty printing, they were made especially for
the stamp booklets, which have grown so popular since
their introduction in 1903. The plates from which the
booklet stamps were printed were divided into four
panes, each of sixty labels. Each pane consisted of ten
rows of six stamps surrounded by a fringe of blank
paper. The panes were cut vertically down the centre
and then along every second horizontal row. This gave
ten blocks of six stamps, five coming from the left of the
vertical cut and five from the right. Now, it was necessary
to have a strip of edging paper on the left of each
block for the binding-pins of the booklet to pass through;
consequently, the stamps placed on the right of the
vertical cut were inverted. As the watermark was not
similarly turned round, the specimens in 50 per cent.
of the booklets were provided with inverted crowns.</p>

<p>The stamps of King George require but little mention.
When first issued they caused considerable adverse comment,
owing to their poor design and inferior gum. The
earliest dies of the halfpenny and penny values were re-engraved
at least twice, but not until the small head was
replaced by the larger profile bust could they be considered
even passable. As a whole, the Georgian first
issue may be now considered fairly attractive in pattern
and colour; but the Mother Country has yet much to
learn in the matter of stamp designing from her young
Dependencies, notably Canada.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">STAMPS WORTH FORTUNES</p>

<p>What a curious thing it is that some stamps&mdash;mere
scraps of paper&mdash;cost over a sovereign apiece to buy!
It is still more wonderful, however, that quite a
number sell for over £100 each, whilst a select few
command prices running into four figures. Probably
the reader will never possess any of the more costly
rarities, and as likely as not he will never see copies of
them, unless he has access to the Tapling or other public
collections; but, none the less, it is interesting for him
to know of them, of their prices, and their peculiarities.</p>

<p>Among the stamps of Great Britain there are a fair
number which are worth between £30 and £100
each. In the previous chapter we spoke of the deep
green shilling of 1862, which sells at £65 in an
unused condition, and the ninepenny straw, catalogued
at £30 when used. To these we may add the famous
£5 orange of 1882, worth about £100 when unused,
and the £1 brown-lilac, also of 1882, which varies
between £90 and £100. Neither of these labels were
in currency for more than two years. This fact,
coupled with their high face value, readily explains
why collectors are so eager to possess them.</p>

<p>There have been three different brown-lilac £1
stamps, all issued within a few years of each other, so
the collector is advised to note their descriptions care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>fully.
The valuable type referred to above measures
1-1/8 by 1-3/8 inches, and is watermarked with an anchor.
Of the remaining two types, one has a watermark consisting
of three crowns (worth £12 unused), and the
other has the watermark known as the three orbs (worth
£20 unused). Both these stamps have the top and
bottom sides much longer than the vertical sides. Other
£1 values, in various colours and designs, command
good prices, and should be carefully preserved, if only
for speculative purposes.</p>

<p>Were the question to be put, "Which is the rarest
stamp in the world?" probably the answer would be,
more often than not, "The twopenny 'Post Office' Mauritius."
Though it is not the rarest, it is probably the
best-known philatelic treasure, and the one which collectors
covet beyond all others. Just how much it is worth
would be difficult to say; we do know, however, that
the copy which figures in King George's Collection was
sold at auction in 1904 for £1,450. Were it placed on
the market to-day, it is safe to say that it would change
hands at a higher figure&mdash;probably a much higher figure.</p>

<p>The twopenny and the penny "Post Office"
Mauritius have an interesting history. The officials
of this little island in the Indian Ocean decided in the
year 1847 to follow the lead of the Mother Country
and issue stamps. Whilst waiting for supplies to come
from England, they commissioned a local watchmaker
to engrave two dies, one for a penny and one for a
twopenny stamp. The watchmaker took a small piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of sheet copper and engraved upon it, side by side, the
two dies, and a neighbouring printer took off 500
impressions&mdash;that is to say, 1,000 stamps in all.
Instead of cutting into the copper the words "Post
Paid," the engraver scratched the inscription "Post
Office" by mistake, with the result that his dies were
soon discarded. The stock of stamps was quickly used
up, for just as the labels were issued, a ball was being
arranged at the Government House, and numerous
invitations were sent out by post. About twenty-two
copies only are known to exist, and most of these have
been discovered on the communications which, nearly
seventy years ago, summoned the Governor's friends
to the long-forgotten festivities.</p>

<p>The rarest stamp in the world is usually considered
to be the one cent (1856) of British Guiana. A single
specimen only of this variety is known, the owner
being Monsieur de la Renotière, a celebrated collector
of Paris. To say that this treasure is worth its weight
in gold is to understate its value by a great deal, for
specialists claim that £2,000 would not buy it.</p>

<p>One would suppose that so costly a square inch of
paper would have a prepossessing appearance or claims
to artistic merit, but the unique specimen is said to be
ugly, of a dullish magenta colour, and not in the best of
condition. The design is a ship, around which the motto
"Damus petimusque vicissim"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is written, together
with the words "British Guiana, Postage One Cent."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> We give and we ask in turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Another very rare British Guiana stamp is the sorry-looking
two cents of 1851. Having more the appearance
of an obliteration stamp than a postal adhesive,
this specimen bears the name of the colony and the
value, two cents, in a circle. It was printed at short
notice by the proprietors of the <i>Royal Gazette</i>, and was
intended to serve for a new rate of letter-carrying which
applied to the town of Georgetown alone. Apparently
the new charge failed to serve its purpose, and was
withdrawn after a brief space of time. Very few copies
were made use of, and those which still exist are worth
about £600 each.</p>

<p>From the Hawaiian Islands comes another valuable
stamp, also of poor design: it is the two cents (1851),
black on bluish paper. This adhesive was printed at
Honolulu, and served mainly for franking the letters
which the American missionaries sent home to their
relations in the States. The issue suffered an untimely
fate, for no sooner had the stamps been put into circulation
than a serious fire devastated the quarter of the
town in which the post office was situated and destroyed
almost all the stock in hand. A round dozen copies
are known to exist. One reposes in the Tapling Collection
at the British Museum, but the authorities have
removed it from the show-cases, where it used to lie, and
placed it under lock and key in the Cracherode Room.
It may be well to add that it can be inspected on request.
Its value is probably £800 or more.</p>

<p>If we turn to the United States, many rarities will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
be found, but none are so much sought after as the
issues known as the "Postmaster Stamps." For the
want of a better term these adhesives have been called
"locals," but they must not be confused with the worthless
labels spoken of in Chapter II.</p>

<p>Each postmaster in the early years of the States
designed and printed his own stamps, and some weird
and curious effects were produced as a result of this
arrangement. The master at Milbury, then a tiny
place in Massachusetts, issued a two cents label (1847)
which was no exception in the matter of design. Milbury
was such a small town that the demand for this
two cents stamp was insignificant, and consequently
to-day copies are worth quite £300.</p>

<p>Another local stamp&mdash;more highly priced on the Continent
than in England&mdash;is the ten centimes "Double
Geneva." This curiosity was issued by the Canton of
Geneva before Switzerland possessed a regular supply
of adhesives. The stamp is composed of two sections,
each bearing the value five centimes, but a narrow strip
of paper joins them together and bears the value ten
centimes. The idea was that, in its entirety, the stamp
would frank a letter anywhere within the Canton of
Geneva, but if cut in halves, the postage was only
sufficient for letters circulating within any individual
commune. A complete "Double Geneva" is worth
£80 odd unused, but a halved copy may be procured
for a £5 note.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter on rarities, some
mention must be made of the triangular "Capes."
Curiously enough, everybody has heard of these stamps,
whether they are collectors or not, and every non-collector
who happens to possess a copy nourishes the idea
that some day a huge fortune may be realized by selling
the valued possession. Granted that the specimen is
not a forgery, which it very well may be, the stamp is
perhaps worth no more than five shillings, for this is the
market price of the fourpenny blue, 1855&mdash;the stamp
most frequently met.</p>

<p>There are two valuable triangular "Capes," however,
namely, the fourpenny red and the penny blue, both
of 1861. The origin of these stamps is as follows: In
making up the dies for printing some penny and fourpenny
stamps, a block of the penny stamp was accidentally
placed in the plate of the fourpenny value,
whilst a fourpenny block found its way into the penny
plate. As a result of this mistake, one stamp on each
sheet which was printed bore the wrong colour for its
value. Gibbons catalogues the blue penny at £85,
and the vermilion fourpenny at £95.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">COMMON STAMPS</p>

<p>Probably the twelve commonest stamps which have
ever been issued are the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Great Britain, Queen, 1d. lilac, 1881.</p>

<p>2. Great Britain, King Edward, 1d. scarlet, 1902.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Germany, 1880, 10 pfennig (without the final "e")
rose.</p>

<p>4. Germany, 1889, 10 pfennig rose.</p>

<p>5. Austria, 5 kr., Francis Joseph, 1857, red.</p>

<p>6. Austria, 5 kr. rose, 1883, double-headed eagle.</p>

<p>7. Austria, 5 kr., Francis Joseph, 1890, red.</p>

<p>8. Belgium, 10 c., Leopold II., 1885, rose.</p>

<p>9. Belgium, 5 c., arms, 1893, green.</p>

<p>10. France, 15 c., Mercury and Commerce, blue, 1877.</p>

<p>11. France, 5 c., Mercury, etc., green, 1877.</p>

<p>12. Hungary, 5 kr., numeral on envelope, rose, 1875.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the above list it will be seen that all but three
of the adhesives are of the penny value, or its foreign
equivalent. The presence of the French three-halfpenny
(15 c.) stamp is due to the fact that, for many
years, this was the rate charged for letters circulating
within the Republic.</p>

<p>Of these stamps the Queen's head of Great Britain
enjoyed the longest life, whilst the two French specimens
took second and third place, they having a prosperous
run of sixteen years to their credit.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking of the length of currency enjoyed
by stamps, it may be well to say that, of all the
adhesive specimens issued throughout the world, the
large fivepenny green, New South Wales, remained unchanged
for a longer period than any other; whilst the
Queen Victoria penny embossed envelope, with a light
pink stamp&mdash;not, of course, an adhesive&mdash;was current
still longer, being on sale from 1841 to 1902. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of these labels, it should be added, may be reckoned
among the commonest varieties.</p>

<p>Of each of the twelve stamps mentioned in the list
above prodigious numbers must have been issued.
Just how many copies of each were used for franking
letters cannot be gauged, but by turning to the postal
records published annually by Great Britain some idea
may be obtained of their colossal totals. During the
year 1913 the General Post Office dealt with&mdash;</p>

<p>
3,298,300,000 letters.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">899,000,000 postcards.</span><br />
<br />
1,079,000,000 halfpenny packets.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">202,300,000 newspapers.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">130,200,000 parcels.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of the letters, postcards, and halfpenny packets, it
seems fair to assume that three-quarters were franked
by halfpenny and penny stamps in the proportion,
probably, of two of the former to one of the latter. In
other words, roughly 1,500,000,000 penny stamps and
2,500,000,000 halfpenny stamps were used in Great
Britain during the year 1913 alone. As the life of
our British stamps averages a trifle over ten years, we
must multiply the huge figures by ten to obtain a
rough estimate of the individual copies which are
likely to be printed of these two stamps.</p>

<p>Looked at from the point of view of use, the dozen
adhesives mentioned above have undoubtedly scored
heavily; but if they be examined from the artistic point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of view, little can be said in their favour. The lilac
head of Victoria, it is true, is a fine dignified stamp;
whilst the two French specimens, depicting Mercury
and Commerce, are pleasing. The remainder, however,
can claim but little respect, either on the score of
design or workmanship. Truly the commonest labels
seem to be the least beautiful!</p>

<p>What can we do with our accumulations of valueless
stamps? is a question often asked by the young philatelist.
A good plan is to collect the various shades of
colour and minute variations of design, which are sure
to creep into issues that extend over a lengthy period.
In this way an interesting assembly of stamps may be
secured which might, in time, prove extremely valuable
to a collector who specialized. The Georgian stamps
of Great Britain, for instance, though they have only
been in use a few years, already show numerous variations
in design and colour, and thus lend themselves to
such work. The halfpenny is known in two or three
shades of green; there are at least two different engravings
of the penny; the twopenny varies in shade
from dark to light orange; whilst the threepenny may
be found in dull purple and also vivid purple.</p>

<p>Another good plan is to make what might be called
a type collection, with the aid of the accumulations of
common stamps. Such a collection should comprise
(<i>a</i>) specimens of all known perforations from eight to
sixteen; (<i>b</i>) cases of varied perforations&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one
gauge for the vertical, another for the horizontal sides;
(<i>c</i>) stamps separated by other means than perforations;
(<i>d</i>) stamps of every shade of the spectrum, arranged
in a line and gradually merging from red through
orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo to violet;
(<i>e</i>) labels printed by different processes; (<i>f</i>) labels
printed on all the commoner forms of paper; (<i>g</i>)
stamps mounted face downwards to reveal the watermarks,
etc.</p>

<p>A third form of collection, which helps to use up
the valueless stamps, is a historical collection. In such
a gathering as we have here in mind, it becomes
possible to trace out, by means of postage labels, such
interesting matters as the genealogical tables of royal
families, the changes which certain Governments have
undergone, lists of succession, etc.</p>

<hr class="r65" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">STAMPS OF SPECIAL INTEREST</p>

<p>Most stamps as they repose in their rows on the
pages of the album look very sober, matter-of-fact, little
squares of paper. Some appear travel-stained, others
are in the pink of condition, but all have undergone
an experience&mdash;we are speaking of the used copies&mdash;which,
could it be related, would make reading matter
of a highly interesting nature. One specimen which
lies in the album did duty, say, in the backwoods of
the United States; another carried a letter across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
snowfields of Siberia; a third franked correspondence
in the unsettled land of Mexico; and a fourth brought
a message from the battlefields of Belgium and Northern
France. Viewed in this light, every obliterated specimen
which figures in our collection is a curiosity.</p>

<p>There are, however, other kinds of curious stamps
which are worth discussing. Who, for instance, would
ever dream that a stamp could cause serious disturbance
among a whole race of some millions of people?
Yet this is what happened quite recently in India. The
offending stamp was the two annas, bearing a profile
portrait of King George. The trouble can be related
briefly. The label showed the King attractively arrayed,
and bearing a number of decorations, one of them
being the elephant which denotes an Indian order.
Unfortunately, the engraving was a trifle indistinct,
and instead of the creature appearing as an elephant,
as it should have done, it seemed to be an exact
representation of a pig. Now, the latter animal is
considered a most unclean thing by all faithful
Mohammedans, and the people of this religious creed
were not slow to suppose that somebody in power had
placed the animal on the King's breast merely to insult
them. Had it not been for the tactful assurances made
by the authorities, and the early substitution of another
stamp more carefully engraved, the results would probably
have been of a serious character.</p>

<p>Another curious stamp is the Connell label, emanating
from the colony of New Brunswick. Connell was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
postmaster-in-chief of this British dependency. On
one occasion he was requested to journey to New
York to place a contract with a firm of stamp printers.
What possessed him nobody knows. Instead of directing
that Queen Victoria's portrait should appear on all
the stamps to be engraved, he ordered that the five
cents value should bear his features, which, to be
candid, were not at all attractive. In due course the
stamps arrived, but the authorities, on discovering
Connell's audacity, issued a proclamation declaring the
label to be worthless. The postmaster, so history tells
us, became angry, and rather than appear before a
prosecuting council retired hastily to the States. The
Connell stamp, needless to say, is a rare curiosity, and
few copies are known to exist. It is perhaps a little
doubtful, however, whether the label can be reckoned
as an authentic postage stamp, seeing that its use never
received official sanction.</p>

<p>Vanity seems to play an important part in the
lives of people&mdash;at least, this is the testimony which
many of our stamps bear out. Some men like
Connell crave for such notoriety as a postage stamp
can afford them, but there are others&mdash;crowned heads&mdash;who
will not allow their features to be portrayed upon
the labels of their country, lest the obliteration marks
may render them grotesque.</p>

<p>Among conceited Kings of recent times, King Ferdinand
of Sicily stands out pre-eminently in the minds
of philatelists. He possessed something of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Connell weakness, for he evinced a keen desire to
have his head portrayed upon the stamps of his little
kingdom; but running counter with this desire was a
strong fear lest the marks of the postal obliterator
should disfigure his none too prepossessing countenance.
In the end, he thought of a kind of compromise.
He called in one of the best engravers of the day and
commanded him to execute a fine series of adhesives
bearing his profile. When the issue was ready,
Ferdinand provided the postal authorities with obliterating
stamps, each of which consisted of a circular
framework of lines, surrounding an empty space.
The idea was that the lines should deface the edges of
the stamp, but that the empty space should save his
profile from disfigurement. What happened to his
overworked officials who chanced to bring their
obliterators down upon the royal countenance by
mistake is too awful to contemplate!</p>

<p>Not only do some stamps betray the weaknesses of
individuals, but others reveal the characters of nations.
Let us look for a moment at the stamps of Belgium.
Each is provided with a small label which bears the
words, "Not to be delivered on Sunday." This
label is very insignificant, and stamp collectors have
seen it so often that they are apt to pass it by unnoticed.
But this tiny strip of paper has a deep underlying
purpose. The Belgians, as a nation, are sharply
divided on matters of religion into two great bodies.
The Roman Catholic section objects to having its letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
delivered on Sundays, whilst the section of Freethinkers
can see no harm in a postal delivery on the
day which we in England set apart for rest. The
Belgians are a tolerant race, however, and the matter
has been settled by providing each stamp with what
has been called a Dominical label. The Catholics use
the label with the stamps they buy, but the Freethinkers
detach them. The postmen are instructed to deliver
letters on Sundays only when the footnote is missing
from the stamps.</p>

<p>Another curious stamp is the twopenny plum colour
King Edward issue of Great Britain. Who has ever
heard of this adhesive? Who has ever seen it? The
chances are that few collectors know that such a stamp
ever existed, yet a used copy figures in the collection
of King George.</p>

<p>The story relating to this stamp is as follows: In
the early months of the year 1910 it was decided to
change both the pattern and colour of the twopenny
green and carmine. A rather attractive design was
selected instead, and eventually printed in a hue which
the authorities called "Tyrian plum." Some thousands
of these labels were printed and held ready for issue,
but just as they were to be placed on sale, the sad
and unexpected death of King Edward took place.
Rather than issue a new stamp after the King's demise,
the whole stock was gathered together and burned.
A few copies, however, were preserved for record
purposes, and one at least was stuck to an envelope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
addressed to our present Sovereign, and posted at
the East Strand Post Office.</p>

<p>The V.R. penny black is another stamp of the Home
Country which every philatelist should know about. It
is a famous label, not because it has ever made history
or fulfilled any important mission, but because people
have grown to look upon it as a rare form of the ordinary
penny black. In reality the V.R. stamps never attained
to the dignity of a postal label, for, although intended for
official use, the authorities decided at the last moment
not to make the issue, and destroyed the stock. A
certain number of copies leaked out, and found their way
into collectors' albums, and these command a fair price.</p>

<p>Of late there has been a great increase all over the
world in the picturesque type of stamp, and these have
provided a fairly large crop of pictorial "inexactitudes."
As an example, two adhesives of the well-known
United States Columbian issue may be mentioned,
seeing that they have evoked many a smile among
philatelists. The stamps in question are the one and
the two cents values. The former portrays Columbus
sighting land, whilst the latter reveals the famous
traveller in the act of landing. As is well known, an
interval of but twenty-four hours separated the two
events, yet in the first picture Columbus appears clean-shaven,
whilst in the latter he possesses a beard of
ample and stately proportions!</p>

<p>Another interesting picture stamp of the United
States is the one dollar value of the Omaha issue. The
stamp bears the title of "Western Cattle in Storm," but
those of us who know the canvasses of MacWhirter will
recognize it as a reproduction of his painting, "The
Vanguard." Mr. F. J. Melville, a noted philatelist,
says in "Chats on Postage Stamps" that the United
States Post Office "literally cribbed" MacWhirter's
picture, apparently without permission or any sort of
payment.</p>

<p>Many stamps possess particular interest owing to
some speciality in manner of production. Just now a
semi-perforated adhesive is becoming popular. Its
upright sides are imperforated, but top and bottom the
usual perforation marks are present. Such specimens
are manufactured in rolls&mdash;not in sheets&mdash;for special
use in automatic machines. They come largely from the
United States and the Union of South Africa, and are,
of course, only available in the penny and halfpenny,
or equivalent, values. These semi-perforated stamps
are of undoubted interest to-day, though the time may
not be far distant when they will completely oust the
usual perforated type.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">FORGED STAMPS</p>

<p>Stamps are forged for two purposes, first to cheat
philatelists, and second to cheat the postal authorities.
The former kind of trade is fairly lucrative, but in
England, at any rate, the production of fictitious stamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for postal uses seldom enjoys more than a short-lived
success.</p>

<p>The forger hardly ever takes up his abode in the
Home Country, for the pains and penalties awaiting
him, when apprehended, are severe. He far prefers a
Continental existence, where he can work his printing-press
in obscurity. His unsavoury wares, however, are
made to circulate in England just as much as abroad,
and the novice must be ever on his guard in consequence.</p>

<p>Some forgers possess elaborate and costly plant, and
have the means of turning out labels printed quite as
well as the originals. But most people in this dishonest
trade are handicapped for capital, and have to rely on
the cheaper processes&mdash;usually lithography&mdash;in the
production of their forgeries. It is here that a knowledge
of the various means of printing stamps proves so
valuable to the collector. A specimen, say, of a line-engraved
stamp produced by lithography immediately
excites suspicion, and a close examination shows it to be
an undoubted counterfeit.</p>

<p>The watermark is another stumbling-block with the
stamp faker of small means. He has no opportunity
of procuring paper impressed with all the various watermarks,
and so he often prints on ordinary paper, and
trusts to the philatelist's ignorance or lack of examining
powers. Of course, the beginner is often caught by
such practices, but it is really wonderful how soon a
serious collector grows to know at sight the real and
the unreal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>An ingenious trick of the forger in a small way of
business consists in transforming a common stamp into
a valuable one. His work is not very arduous, and his
apparatus costs but a few pence. All he needs is an
aptitude for drawing, a few paints, brushes, and some
chemicals. He selects, first of all, an issue where the
stamps all bear an identical design and are printed in
the same colour, the value, and perhaps an additional
word or two, only being printed in a distinctive colour.
His choice of stamp is by no means limited, for in
Queen Victoria's time it was a favourite arrangement
with many Colonies for the head and ornamentation to
be printed in a shade of purple and the name of the
colony and the price to vary on each value.</p>

<p>The forger takes a nice copy of the halfpenny, and
cleans out the price and any features which make the
stamp distinctive, by means of chemicals; then he fills
in the blank areas with the particular lettering&mdash;using,
of course, the correct colour&mdash;of a high-priced stamp.
His work takes but a few minutes, and in this time
he can transform a label worth, say, a penny into one
catalogued at, perhaps, ten shillings. This form of
faking is particularly dangerous, because such distinguishing
marks as perforations, watermark, and quality
of paper, are correct in every detail.</p>

<p>The length to which some forgers will go is positively
amazing. A few years back a case came to light where
one of these rogues regularly used real stamp-paper on
which to print his worthless imitations. His plan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to buy a whole sheet of low-priced unused stamps, to
remove all the printing by chemical means, and then to
print on the blank paper so obtained a complete sheet
of high-priced stamps. Of course, he had to select his
paper and his stamps with care, but this was a matter
simple enough. It is interesting to point out that the
home authorities, seeing the possibility of such practices,
have made it a rule to use one watermark for adhesives
of low value and another for those of high value.</p>

<p>What is the best way to tell whether a specimen is a
forgery? This is a question often asked. The first
test is the watermark, but sufficient has been said already
to show that too much faith must not be placed on this
detail, especially as we may add that a very respectable
imitation may be produced by painting the back of the
label with oil. The next point to note is the perforation.
These marks must be shaped in a business-like
way, and be of the correct number as indicated by the
catalogues. The third point is the printing, and the
fourth the colour of the ink used. Lastly, the design
should be compared with an identical stamp known to
be genuine. Beyond such simple tests as these the
collector needs to exercise ordinary common sense in
arriving at a conclusion. If, say, a specimen is nice
and fresh, and the catalogue tells us that it is at least
fifty years old, a certain amount of suspicion might not
be out of place.</p>

<p>It is not always a simple matter to know whether
a stamp is a forgery or not. Cases are on record where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the postal authorities themselves have been unable to
distinguish between the real and the unreal. Some
years ago the shilling value of Great Britain was counterfeited
and used for postal purposes not once or twice,
but some thousands of times, and never an atom of
suspicion was excited. The case is recorded by Mr.
F. J. Melville in his work, "Chats on Postage Stamps,"
in the following words:</p>

<p>"A romantic forgery, and one of almost colossal
magnitude, was discovered in 1898. About that time
a large quantity of British one shilling stamps&mdash;those
of the 1865 type in green, with large uncoloured letters
in the corners&mdash;came on the market, though, as they
had been used on telegram forms, they ought to have
been destroyed; probably the guilty parties relied on
this official practice, not always honoured in observance,
as offering a security against not merely the tracing of
the offence, but the discovering of the fraud itself.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, after a lapse of twenty-six years, it was
found that amongst these one shilling stamps there was
a large proportion of forgeries (purporting to be from
Plate V.), all used on July 23, 1872, at the Stock
Exchange Telegraph Office, London, E.C. More
recent discoveries show that the fraud was continued
over twelve months, and, as an indication of the precautions
taken by the forgers, Plate VI. (which came
into use in March, 1872) was duly imitated, although
the change of the small figures was a detail probably
never noticed by members of the general public.</p>

<p>"According to calculations based on the average
numbers used on several days, the Post Office must
have lost about £50 a day during the period mentioned
above. Who were the originators and perpetrators of
the fraud will probably never be known; possibly a
stockbroker's clerk (or a small 'syndicate' of these
gentlemen), or, more probably, a clerk in the Post
Office itself. It was an ingenious fraud, well planned,
and cleverly carried out at a minimum of risk, and but
for the market for old stamps it would never have been

<p>For purposes of reference, we give below a list of
the stamps which have been most frequently copied,
together with hints on how to detect the forgeries.
(G. = genuine; F. = forgery.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alsace and Lorraine.</span>&mdash;G., the points of the network
in the background turned up; F. has them
turned down. The "P" of word "Postes" farther
from margin in G. than F. Used copies more likely
to be G. than unused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belgium.</span>&mdash;One centime, Leopold, 1861. F., yellowish
paper instead of white. The word "Postes" has
no outline round each letter in F. Obliterated specimens
often F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brazil.</span>&mdash;The early issues, with numerals in centre
of filigree work often imitated. Paper too thick in F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Germany.</span>&mdash;Nearly all the rarer stamps have been
copied; specimens should be accepted with caution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cape of Good Hope.</span>&mdash;Triangular issues, 1853-1864.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
G. has knee of "Hope" rounded; F., angular. If
top line of knee produced to border, it cuts through
the centre of the letter "S." in "Postage," in G. but
through letter "O" in F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprus.</span>&mdash;The line-engraved Great Britain issue
with overprint. In this case forged overprints have been
added to genuine stamps. Forgeries have the "C" in
"Cyprus" thicker than the other letters, also the "Y" set
higher than other letters. The extreme length from
"C" to "S" is seldom accurate, as given in catalogues,
in F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">France.</span>&mdash;The five francs, 1869. F. perforated 13;
G. perforated 13-1/2. Also F. has dots in corner of
frame, not rounded as in G.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mauritius.</span>&mdash;Many of the earlier issues F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevis.</span>&mdash;The shilling green, 1861. In G. ink seems
to stand up from paper, but flat in F. The lines on
woman's arm are straight in G., but in dots in F.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New South Wales.</span>&mdash;The stamps known as "Sydney
Views" have been largely copied. The large fivepenny,
sixpenny, eightpenny, and shilling often had
unusually wide margins when perforated. The faker has
trimmed off the tooth edges, and called the stamps the

<p class="center">PIONEERS OF POSTAGE</p>

<p>In a previous chapter we spoke of the penny black
of 1840 as the first postage label to be given to the
world. The reader must not suppose from this remark
that the appearance of the stamp coincided with the
commencement of an organized postal system in Great
Britain. Such a thing as a post was known to exist
in this country as far back as the year 1609, but not
until some thirty years later were its operations extended
to the public in general.</p>

<p>Across the sea, in France, the idea of letter-carrying
was also developing in this period of stress and struggle.
In the year when Cromwell was installed as "Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>tector,"
a Comte de Villayer was permitted to place
pillar-boxes in the thoroughfares of Paris and provide
the inhabitants with a local postal service. Villayer
seems to have been greatly concerned as to the best
method of collecting the postage on the letters placed
in his charge until the idea of issuing a wrapper bearing
some distinctive design occurred to him. These paper
bands were placed on sale in a number of shops, and
cost two sous apiece. Each letter had to be wrapped
in one of them, which Villayer's men tore off prior to
effecting delivery. The system is of unusual interest
to philatelists, because the ornamental wrapper devised
by this Frenchman supplies us with the origin from
which postage stamps sprang.</p>

<p>At home the business of letter-carrying was growing
with considerable rapidity, considering how troublous
were these times. Villayer's counterpart in London
was a man named Dockwra. He organized a system of
depots throughout the city for receiving correspondence.
People took their letters to these depots, paid
the postage in actual coin, and an attendant franked
the communications by means of a hand stamp. This
was a device exactly similar to the obliterating stamps
seen to-day on the counters of our post offices.
Dockwra's hand stamp bore a triangular design bearing
the curious legend, "Post Payd, Peny."</p>

<p>We now know the history of the first stamped wrapper,
the first franking stamp, and the first adhesive stamp.
At this point we will speak of the first stamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
envelope. The "Mulready," as this pioneer envelope
was called, owed its origin to Sir Rowland Hill and
his co-workers. The penny black adhesive label was
considered to be too great an innovation by Sir
Rowland's followers, and, as a sort of compromise, it
was decided to issue a stamped envelope as an alternative
to the penny adhesive. The two were placed on
sale at the same moment, and, curiously enough, the
adhesive immediately proved a tremendous success,
whilst the Mulready only received slight favours. This
happened in spite of the fact that the authorities were
confident that the stamped envelope would prove the
more popular of the two.</p>

<p>The Mulready was a curious, if not weird, production.
The design covered half of the face of the
envelope, and consisted of Britannia surrounded by
people and animals treated symbolically. The paper
used for the envelope bore the silk threads spoken
of in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>The Mulready deserved a better fate. All the comic
papers at the time reproduced grotesque imitations
of it; every wit used it disparagingly, and in all ways
it became a butt for humour. Perhaps the best-known
caricatures of this unfortunate envelope were those
produced by Doyle, a boy of fifteen. Though his
drawings never received postal sanction, they are often
sold by stamp dealers and treasured by collectors as
curiosities.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Mulready, we must admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
two other envelopes claim to be older than this production
of Sir Rowland Hill. The first is the special-letter
cover, which was issued to members of Parliament
in January, 1840, and the second, the New South Wales
embossed envelope of 1838. Of the former we need
only say that its use was merely of a private nature,
whilst of the latter our knowledge is very imperfect
and hardly trustworthy.</p>

<p>The first postcard was issued by Germany in comparatively
recent times; its use was suggested by
Dr. von Stephan, a high authority in postal matters.
The pioneer letter-card emanated from the Kingdom
of Belgium, and bore a red ten centimes stamp with the
head of Leopold II.</p>

<p>Having discussed the earliest forms of postal
stationery, it will be interesting to examine certain of
the adhesive stamps which claim notoriety on account
of their positions as pioneers. The first stamp of all,
as we have said before, was the penny black of Great
Britain, but the earliest issue of foreign stamps (<i>i.e.</i>,
omitting those of Great Britain) dates from the year
1843, and came from Brazil. The labels are not attractive
in appearance; they are large, and bear large
numerals surrounded by a circular background of
filigree work. They have been nicknamed, not inappropriately,
the bull's eye stamps of Brazil. The
stamps remained in currency but one year, and are,
therefore, rare.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to think that Brazil&mdash;a republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
not usually associated with progressive measures&mdash;should
have been, with Great Britain, the only country to issue
stamps for nine whole years after their introduction.
In short, no other Government issued adhesives until
the January of 1849. On the first of that month,
however, both Belgium and France provided stamps
for the convenience of their people. The Belgian
stamp consisted of two varieties&mdash;the ten centimes,
dark brown, and the twenty centimes, blue, both
bearing a head and shoulder engraving of Leopold I.
In France one label was issued; it bore the value
of ten centimes, in dark brown, and was ornamented
with the head of Ceres. These three specimens were,
therefore, the first adhesives to receive recognition on
the Continent.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to note how Brazil, Belgium, and
France, all imitated Great Britain in the colour and
values of their first issues; it is also an interesting
coincidence that the earliest labels of all these
countries, Great Britain included, were extremely short-lived.</p>

<p>The first colonial stamps were the two Mauritius
"line-engravings," which were described at length in
the chapter dealing with rare specimens.</p>

<p>The first picture stamp is often taken to be the large
Congo adhesive bearing a view of the port of Matadi,
whilst sometimes pride of place is awarded to the
Columbus ship stamp of the Argentine Republic. In
reality neither of these can claim the honour of being
the forerunner of our picture issues, an honour which
rightly belongs to the early "Sydney Views" of New
South Wales. These latter stamps are extremely scarce,
and change ownership for from £5 to £10 a copy.</p>

<p>Turning now to the stamps of our Mother Country,
the penny black may be again mentioned as being
the first adhesive to bear the head of Queen Victoria.
King Edward was first revealed to us philatelically by
the halfpenny, penny, twopence-halfpenny, and sixpenny
values of Great Britain&mdash;these four stamps being issued
on the same day, January 1, 1902. King George's
earliest stamp was the twopence-halfpenny label issued
by the Union of South Africa.</p>

<p class="center">COMMEMORATIVE STAMPS</p>

<p>In recent times it has become fashionable, in certain
countries, to celebrate national events by means of
special issues of stamps. The idea is a very acceptable
one so long as it is not abused. Unfortunately, however,
we must say that many countries do abuse this
interesting way of commemorating their historic achievements.
The consolidation of an empire, the discovery
of a continent, the centenary of a great victory, are all
matters of history which we are glad to see recorded in
the pages of the stamp album; but when a series of
labels is issued to acquaint the world of the death of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
unheard-of poet, or the erection of an obscure post
office, then we can only surmise that the stamps were
printed more for philatelic than postal purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

<p>Commemorative stamps coming from most European
countries, also the British Colonies, may usually be
accepted for collecting purposes, but those which hail
from one or other of the South American republics
should be purchased with caution. Some of these
Governments simply cast around for events to celebrate,
hoping that each new issue will help to swell the national
exchequer in no little measure.</p>

<p>Probably the first celebration issue of any country
was the penny envelope of Great Britain, bearing
a blue stamp, which appeared on July 2, 1890.
The occasion was the jubilee of the "Uniform Penny
Postage," an event which was celebrated by a festival
held in the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The envelope is undoubtedly attractive. Beyond
the familiar profile portrait of Queen Victoria, and an
artistic rendering of her coat of arms, it bears a picture
of the North Mail coach making for Highgate in 1790
at eight miles an hour. In contrast to this antiquated
method of locomotion we are also shown the North
Mail railway express approaching Carlisle at forty-eight
miles an hour. Two other figures, one a letter-carrier
of 1840, and the other a postman of 1890, complete the
ornamentation.</p>

<p>This envelope, and a correspondence-card enclosed
within it, which appropriately bears a portrait of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Rowland Hill, was sold by post offices on the one day
only for sixpence. Though it is a curiosity worth
obtaining, there is little demand for it, and dealers are
glad to supply copies even now at the original price.</p>

<p>Among the stamps of our Colonies, those of Newfoundland
have always been attractive; but probably
the set which was issued to celebrate the four hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of the island by Jean Cabot
is the most interesting of all. Cabot, it will be remembered,
though born in Genoa, settled in Bristol as a
merchant. In 1497 he was commissioned by Henry VII.
to search for undiscovered lands. He set out with
two small ships, and sighted first Newfoundland, then
Cape Breton Isle, and afterwards Nova Scotia. In 1498
he died.</p>

<p>From Newfoundland to Canada is not a great distance.
To this British Dominion we are indebted for
two fine commemorative sets. The first, that of 1897,
was issued in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond
Jubilee, and the second to celebrate the tercentenary
of the founding of Quebec. This town, on the St.
Lawrence River, owes its origin to Jacques Cartier, a
Frenchman born at St. Malo. Cartier sailed from his
native port in 1534 accompanied by two small vessels
of twenty tons apiece. He landed on the Gaspé shores
and claimed the territory for French sovereignty. His
stay was of short duration, for we read that in 1535
he again set out from St. Malo, and this time sailed up
the mouth of the St. Lawrence and landed at a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
native settlement, which afterwards received the name
of Quebec. (<i>Kebek</i> is the Indian for "The Rock.") We
are bound to state that little came of Cartier's exploits,
for not until Champlain visited the district many years
later, with the dual purpose of spreading Christianity
and opening up commerce, did the French settlement
prosper.</p>

<p>The pictures on the stamps are of interest. The
1 cent portrays both Cartier and Champlain; the 5 cents
gives a picture of the latter's house; the 7 cents introduces
Montcalm and Wolfe; the 10 cents reveals
Quebec in 1700; the 15 cents depicts Champlain's
departure for the interior, then an almost unknown
world; whilst the 20 cents is inscribed "Cartier's
arrival before Quebec."</p>

<p>Another set of commemorative stamps comes from
Barbados, its object being to celebrate the heroic exploits
of Nelson&mdash;the Battle of Trafalgar in particular.
The tragedy which was enacted on board the <i>Victory</i>,
almost, if we may so express it, at the moment of victory,
the mournful journey to England, the lying-in-state at
Greenwich, and the funeral in St. Paul's Cathedral, are
all too well known to need description; but it is less
well known that Horatio Nelson spent many of his
early years of seamanship in the West Indies, and particularly
in and around the Barbados. It is on this
account that a fine monument has been erected to his
memory in this Colony, and a set of stamps was issued
to mark the unveiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Australasia has not given us many celebration stamps,
but those which have come from the Antipodes are
extremely interesting. What could be more stirring
than the design on the three-halfpenny 1901 khaki
stamp of New Zealand? It was issued to mark the
departure of troops on their way to the fighting-line
in South Africa.</p>

<p>Another interesting set of stamps was provided some
twenty years ago by New South Wales to remind the
world that it had been a colony for just over a century.
One of the values bears a portrait of Captain Cook, who
discovered the Colony in 1770; whilst another reveals,
appropriately enough, the features of Captain Arthur
Phillips, the founder of the first convict settlement on
these Australian shores. Up till the time of Phillips
our prisoners had been banished to America, but after
the war, which gained for the New England States
their independence, this outlet was closed to our exiles,
and fresh fields were found in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Probably no event in history has received more attention
on the part of stamp producers than the discoveries
of Columbus. The Argentine Republic was, we believe,
the first country to honour the memory of this intrepid
explorer by the issue of postal labels, but to the United
States must be awarded the credit of issuing the finest
set of Columbian stamps. This series of postal adhesives
is probably one of the grandest collections of
historical stamps that has ever been produced, and, fortunately,
the lower values are cheap, and easily obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Other commemorative stamps of the United States
have been issued&mdash;namely, the Omaha, the Pan-American,
the Buffalo, and the Panama Exhibition stamps;
but though some of them are exceedingly attractive in
design, none of them can compare with the Columbus
issue in point of interest.</p>

<p>Another intrepid explorer to receive recognition by
means of an issue of stamps was Vasco da Gama. To
mention his name recalls to mind the wonderful and
perilous journey which he was the first to make around
the southern point of Africa, and thence to India.
Vasco was fortunate in living in Portugal at a time
when this kingdom was at the height of its fame and
prosperity. Financed by the then King, Manoel, he
left Lisbon on July 8, 1497, with four vessels manned
by 160 men. He took four long months to reach the
island of St. Helena, and whilst rounding the Cape the
trials of this brave band of men were terrible in the
extreme. Calicut, in India, was reached on May 20,
1498, and after a short and none too pleasant stay
among the unfriendly natives, a start for home was
made. On returning to Portugal Vasco da Gama received
a tremendous ovation from the King and the
people.</p>

<p>The Portuguese stamps issued in 1898 to celebrate
the fourth centenary of the discovery of the route to
India bear very attractive pictures.</p>

<p>Three events of interest have given rise to special
stamps in Italy: (<i>a</i>) The fiftieth anniversary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
freedom of Sicily; (<i>b</i>) the jubilee of the kingdom of
Italy; and (<i>c</i>) the festivities to commemorate the completion
of the Venice Campanile.</p>

<p>To appreciate the meaning of the first two events,
we must remember that the present kingdom of Italy
was, less than sixty years ago, a number of little states,
each contending against its neighbour. Sicily, one of
the conflicting areas, was ruled by Ferdinand II. of
Spain, a man noted for the harsh and tyrannical rule
which he inflicted on his subjects. In answer to an
appeal from the men of Sicily, Garibaldi sailed from
Genoa with 1,000 followers, landed at Marsala on
May 11, 1860, and took Palermo soon afterwards.
The people were jubilant at his success, and Ferdinand
was quickly deposed. Sicily joined Sardinia, and
Victor Emmanuel reigned over the two territories.</p>

<p>In the same year, Central Italy, Southern Italy, the
Papal States, and Naples, all joined the kingdom of
Emmanuel and, in February, 1861, the first Parliament
of all the Italian States was held at Turin. It was
this event that was celebrated by the Italian Jubilee
stamps.</p>

<p>The third event which the Italian stamps commemorated
was the completion of the new Campanile in
Venice. The old monument collapsed on the square
of St. Mark's some ten years ago, and a new erection
of similar design to the original one has been built in
its place.</p>

<p>A very attractive series of stamps was placed on sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
throughout Austria in 1908 to commemorate the
sixtieth year of the reign of Franz Joseph I. The labels
are particularly interesting, as they reveal to us many
Austrian rulers about whom our history books have
much to say. They are as follows:</p>

<p>1 heller: Karl VI. Best known, perhaps, as the father
of Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>2 heller: Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>3 heller: Joseph II. A great reformer, but a very
harsh ruler.</p>

<p>5, 10, 25, 30, and 35 heller: Franz Joseph I.</p>

<p>6 heller: Leopold II. Brother and successor to
Joseph II. Pacified the Netherlands and Hungary which
his elder brother had inflamed.</p>

<p>12 heller: Franz I. Assisted Napoléon in his campaign
against Russia, and later joined with other
countries to break Napoleon's power.</p>

<p>20 heller: Ferdinand. Was persuaded to abdicate in
favour of Franz Joseph, as he was too weak to rule in
such troublous times.</p>

<p>The last commemorative stamps of which we shall
speak were issued in 1913 by Russia to honour the
House of Romanoff. The adhesives are printed in
attractive colours, with bold designs, indicative of
Russian art. The heads revealed to us in this striking
portrait-gallery are those of Nicholas II., Peter I.,
Alexander II., Alexander III., Peter II., Katherine II.,
Nicholas I., Alexander I., Alexei Michaelovitch, Paul I.,
Elizabeth and Michael Feodorovitch.</p>

<p>Many other celebration stamps have appeared from
time to time in various countries; notice of them may
be found in any postage stamp catalogue.</p>

<p class="center">INTERESTING PICTURE STAMPS</p>

<p>That the picture stamps reposing in our collections
are highly instructive as well as interesting needs little
argument. We can sit in an armchair and learn the
geography of half the world by means of the stamps
bearing maps; we may wander, mentally, as far as the
Antipodes, thanks to the stamps bearing views; we
may learn about the birds of the air and the beasts of
the forests from the stamps bearing animals. Matters
of architecture, heraldry, local customs, mythology, and
history, are other subjects which we may become
acquainted with from our postage adhesives.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting labels are those which
portray the natural wonders of the wide-world. Let us
turn first of all to the specimens from New Zealand.
What delightful views the 1898 stamps give of Mount
Cook, Lake Wakatipu, Mount Ruapehu, Lake Taupo,
the Pink Terrace of Rotomahana and Milford Sound&mdash;names
which to many of us are mere places mentioned
in dry geography manuals, but here revealed in all
their glory!</p>

<p>From New Zealand let us wander to Tasmania. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
these pages of our album we find interesting pictures of
Lake Marion, Mount Wellington, the town of Hobart,
Russell Falls, Lake St. Clair, and the waterfalls of
Dilston.</p>

</span>
</div>

<p>Curious though it may seem, waterfalls are favourite
subjects for stamp ornamentation. We have Niagara
on the 5 cents United States value of 1901; the
Llandovery Falls on the 1d. 1900, Jamaica; the
Kaieteur Falls on the 10 cents 1898 of British Guiana;
the Stanley Falls and the Inkissi Falls on the 1894
Congo issue; also the Victoria Falls on the 1905 issue
of British South Africa. Were we to place these
picture stamps and others representing similar subjects
side by side on a page by themselves in our collection,
we should have quite a fine array of the world's most
noted waterfalls.</p>

<p>Perhaps next to waterfalls, mountain views claim
most popularity on postage labels. Besides those
mentioned already, we have Mount Kini Balou on the
18 cents 1894, North Borneo; Table Mountain on
the 1d. 1900, Cape of Good Hope; the Leon mountains
on various Nicaraguan issues; Popocatepetl on the
1 peso 1899, Mexico; Mount Konaluanui on the
2 cent 1894, Hawaii, and others.</p>

<p>Historic buildings are, as one would expect, frequently
represented in our collections. A most interesting
stamp is the Chinese label bearing a view of the Temple
of Heaven, a sacred edifice erected to the memory of
Confucius, to which the Emperor repairs periodically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and prays for the favour of Heaven. The Kremlin and
Winter Palace, both well-known Russian buildings,
figure on the stamps of the Tsar. The Grecian
adhesives reveal pictures of the Acropolis, including the
Parthenon and Stadium; the Egyptian adhesives show
a sphinx and the Pyramids; a Dominican adhesive bears
a picture representing the Mausoleum of Columbus;
whilst a recent issue from Turkey, celebrating the
recapture of Adrianople, bears a fine view of the Mosque
of Selim.</p>

<p>Of curious things our stamps provide us in plenty.
A Newfoundland adhesive shows an iceberg; a Toga
stamp, a breadfruit-tree; a Tasmanian stamp, Tasman's
Arch; a Kedah stamp, a sheaf of rice; a North Borneo
stamp, a sago palm; a Columbian stamp, an American
execution; a Bahamas stamp, a staircase; another Toga
stamp, a prehistoric trilith; a Canadian stamp, a map
of the British possessions; a Roumanian stamp, a
picture of the Queen nursing a wounded soldier; a
Portuguese stamp, the vision of St. Anthony; a
Liberian stamp, a coffee plantation; a United States
stamp, an aeroplane; and a Peruvian stamp, a suspension
bridge.</p>

<p>The Toga trilith, it may be well to explain, is an
erection composed of three large blocks of stone placed
together like door-posts and a lintel, and standing by
themselves. It may be compared with the monuments
at Stonehenge, or the Druidical monoliths to be seen at
Carnac, in Brittany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>If mythology be of interest, the stamps of Greece
will prove attractive. This country offers some capital
pictures of gladiators, disc-throwers, wrestlers; of
Hermes, Apollo, Atlas, Iris, Pallas Athene; of ancient
chariots, vases; as well as tableaux representing such
incidents as "Atlas offering the apples of Hesperides to
Hercules," and "The struggle between Hercules and
Antæus."</p>

<p>Ships, some noted and others merely curious, figure
on many labels. We have an Atlantic schooner on a
Newfoundland stamp; a native canoe on a Papuan
stamp; a Nile steamboat on an Egyptian stamp; a
dhow on a Borneo stamp; the flagship of Columbus
on a Grenada stamp; Cabot's ship, the <i>Matthew</i>,
leaving the Avon, and Guy's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, on
Newfoundland stamps; and the <i>Hohenzollern</i>, the
German Emperor's yacht, on the unattractive stamps
of the German colonies.</p>

<p>Of animals there are far too many for individual
mention, but the following are some of those depicted
in our "philatelic zoo": A kangaroo, zebra, dromedary,
camel, platypus, elephant, hippopotamus, lizard,
giraffe, dog, gnu, codfish, springbok, seal, egret, parrot,
wryneck, emu, lyre bird, ptarmigan, chimpanzee, boar,
rhinoceros, honey bear, ourang-outang, stag, argus
pheasant, panther, crocodile, and kiwi.</p>

<p>Some entire issues of stamps are particularly interesting
if they be considered solely from the pictorial
standpoint. Probably the Bosnian issue of 1906 is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
finest in this matter. The scenes represented in this
attractive collection are&mdash;</p>

<p>Sarajevo, it will be remembered, was the scene of
the assassination of the Austrian Archduke, in 1914,
whilst other places shown in the above pictures have
come to our notice through the despatches bearing on
the great European War.</p>

<p>How can we make the most of all these interesting
and beautiful picture stamps? Quite a good plan is
to build up a collection devoted to these attractive
labels alone, arranging them not according to their
countries, but according to the subject represented by
them. For instance, there are sufficient stamps portraying
animals to permit of a zoological section,
arranged in scientific groups&mdash;mammals, birds, reptiles,
etc. Of course, a good deal of written explanations
should be provided with each adhesive. The
Greek stamp representing Atlas might be followed by
a brief account of the arduous duties imposed upon
this unfortunate hero; the Toga stamp with the
trilith might be accompanied by the short note given
a few paragraphs above; whilst the stamps bearing
geographical features might have little sketch-maps
placed underneath them so that their exact positions
may be learnt. If this plan be followed, the picture
stamps will become extremely fascinating, and our
store of general knowledge enhanced considerably.</p>

<p class="center">STAMPS AND HISTORY</p>

<p>What a wealth of history is recalled by a glance
through the pages of our stamp albums! The romantic
changes which France has undergone, the efforts made
by Germany for securing a wider empire, the ups and
downs of Spain, the gradual growth of Italy, and a
hundred other indications of progress and decay are
all reflected therein.</p>

<p>Let us take, first of all, the case of Germany. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the earliest years we find stamps issued by a multitude
of little States&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Baden, Bavaria, Bergedorf,
Brunswick, Hanover, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Odenburg,
Prussia, Saxony, etc.&mdash;whilst the towns of
Hamburg, Bremen, and Lubeck also had individual
postal rights of their own. The first step of consolidation
came on January 1, 1868, when most of the
above authorities joined what was called the North
German Confederation, and nearly all of the separate
units ceased to issue stamps. The Confederation adhesives
were current from 1868 to 1871&mdash;that is, until
the German Empire sprang into being. When the
Franco-German War of 1870-1871 placed the provinces
of Alsace and Lorraine under Prussian rule, special
German stamps were sold in the captured territory.
As they bore values in centimes, they were withdrawn
as soon as "groschens" and "kreuzers" became
generally current. A less important instance of
Prussian absorption occurred on August 9, 1890,
when the labels of Heligoland bearing a portrait of
Queen Victoria were replaced by the regular German
stamps. Further Teutonic progress is made evident
by the numerous colonial issues which this kingdom has
placed on sale since 1897. Lastly, may be mentioned the
adhesives bearing the familiar effigy of "Germania,"
overprinted for use in Belgium.</p>

<p>The stamps of Spain are also interesting. The first
issue (January 1, 1850) bore very crude portraits of
the unscrupulous Queen Isabella II. Various sets, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of them highly inartistic, were issued between 1850
and 1868. In the latter year a revolution occurred,
and the Queen was deposed, a republic being instituted
instead of the monarchy. Isabella's stamps were temporarily
overprinted with the words "HABILITADO POR
LA NACION," and when the stock was exhausted, a new
design, bearing an allegorical head typifying Liberty
and Spain, became current. The republic did not last
long, for the claims to the throne of the Duke of
Aosta were considered well founded, and he was
crowned King in 1872. Amadeus, as he was called,
figured on the stamps for a brief twelve months.
These were stormy times. Unable to cope with them,
he abdicated, and the republic was reinstated, the new
stamps bearing first an allegorical figure of Peace and
then of Justice. But even the representative Government
was short-lived. The people once more turned
to the House of Bourbon, and Alfonso XII. became
King. He reigned ten years, and was then succeeded
by his son, Alfonso XIII., the present ruling Sovereign.</p>

<p>The Italian adhesives are no less interesting. We
have already indicated the manner in which Modena,
Naples, Parma, Romagna, the Roman States, Sicily,
Tuscany, and Sardinia joined together to form the
Kingdom of Italy, and elected the King of Sardinia
to be the new Sovereign. This latter was Victor
Emmanuel II. He was succeeded by his son, Humbert
I., who fell by the assassin's hand whilst riding on
the outskirts of Milan in 1900. The present King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a fine example of soldier and statesman, is Victor
Emmanuel III.</p>

<p>Probably no stamps reveal greater matters of historical
importance than those of our neighbour, France.
When adhesives were first issued by this country a
republic was in power, and so an allegorical head, that
of Ceres, embellished the new labels. In 1852 Louis
Napoléon became President of the Republic, and, being
a man who loved notoriety, he placed his bust upon
the ten and twenty-five centimes values. Later on, as
is known to all, he became Napoléon III.,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Emperor
of the French, and the wording on the adhesives was
changed from <span class="smcap">REPUB. FRANC.</span> to <span class="smcap">EMPIRE FRANC.</span> Later
on, in 1863, to mark the successes which the French
won over the Austrians, the head of Napoléon was
encircled in a laurel crown. The final stage was
reached in October, 1870, when the Germans gained
an almost crushing victory over the French. As a
result, the Empire fell, and a republic once more
ruled over the country. The head of the Emperor
was removed from the stamps, and Ceres again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
appeared upon them. Thus the adhesives of France
plainly indicate the changing course taken by the
Government of our neighbour across the Channel.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> As there was no Napoléon II., readers may wonder why the
above monarch received the title of Napoléon III. The reason is a
highly amusing one. The draft of the proclamation issued by the
Government announcing his ascendancy to the throne commenced
with the following words: "<span class="smcap">Vive Napoléon!!!</span>" The printer took
the three exclamation marks to be the figures III, and his press
accordingly reproduced the mistake some thousands of times over.
Before the error was discovered, Paris and the other great towns
had been placarded with the incorrect imprints. There was no
time to lose, so the Emperor, much to the amusement of his
courtiers, agreed to take the title of Napoléon III.</p></div>

<p>If we turn to the stamps of Portugal, a most interesting
array of monarchs will be revealed. Queen Maria
figures upon the earliest stamps, but after two years
of currency her portrait gave place to that of King
Pedro V., which in turn was followed by a representation
of King Luiz. In 1889 King Carlos ascended the
throne, and his effigy was given on the issues of 1892
and 1895. The assassination of Carlos and his elder
son, which shocked the whole world, resulted in the
appearance of King Manoel's features upon the stamps
printed between 1908 and 1910. The events which
marred his short and stormy reign are known to all,
and in 1910 he took up his abode in England. Afterwards
a republic sprang up, and the present adhesives
bear the imprint of Liberty.</p>

<p>If we leave Europe and examine the stamps of the
remaining four continents, many other events of great
historical bearing will be revealed. The labels of the
Transvaal, for instance, tell of two British occupations
and two republics; the Egyptian labels show Turkish
influence followed by a British protectorate; the early
United States labels hint at the war which was waged
to put down slavery; whilst the Cuban labels indicate
Spanish occupation, followed first by the protection of
the United States, and then by the creation of an independent
republic. The adhesives of the Central and
South American republics are worthy of special note,
as they point to insurrections, wars, provisional governments,
and troublous times in general. But no matter
where we turn in our albums, interesting landmarks of
the world's history will be revealed by our treasured
labels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">WAR STAMPS</p>

<p>Among the most interesting stamps which figure in
our collections are those which owe their origin to the
stern necessities of war. Stamps which fall into this
division are of two main classes: those needed for the
use of troops fighting outside their own territory, and
those called into being by the subjugation of the
enemy's country.</p>

<p>The Great War of Europe, as the conflict of 1914-15
has been called, has naturally provided many additions
to the list of war stamps.</p>

<p>1. Germany has overprinted its own labels with the
word "Belgien," and these are of some rarity when in
a used condition.</p>

<p>2. Many of the German colonial issues have been
overprinted with words suggesting British or French
occupation. We have, for instance, the Togo yacht
stamps bearing the inscription "Anglo-French Occupation,"
and the Samoa yacht labels stamped with the
letters "G.R.I."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

3 Joseph II      6 Franz I                 9 Franz Josef in 1878

</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In cases where the German colonial issues have
run short in the conquered settlements we find that
labels of British or French origin have been pressed
into service&mdash;for instance, New Zealand stamps have
been overprinted for use in Samoa.</p>

<p>All these classes of war labels permit of many interesting
varieties, but, whenever possible, used specimens
should be preferred to those which have not passed through
the post. We make this statement because certain
belligerent countries endeavoured to replenish their exchequers
by the sale, to philatelists, of uncancelled copies.</p>

<p>The stamps used by troops who are fighting outside
their own territory are probably the most valuable of
war labels. The British Expeditionary Force in France
and Belgium was at the outset provided with ordinary
English postal adhesives. These adhesives, when
bearing such postmarks as "Army Base Post Office,
France," or the ordinary cancel marks of Ostend,
Boulogne, Paris, etc., are extremely valuable. When
the British stamps ran short, letters were franked by
postmarks alone, and these are well worth collecting.
The circular and rectangular marks bearing the word
"Passed by Censor" are also interesting.</p>

<p>Communications coming from the Fleet bear cancel
marks formed by a number of concentric rings. The
varieties of this postal mark should be prized.</p>

<p>In all cases the complete envelope or card must be
placed in the collection intact, and not just the cut-out
postmark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably the most carefully planned army postal service
is that possessed by our Indian troops. Adhesive
stamps are generally used on correspondence, the
ordinary Indian issues, overprinted with the letters
I.E.F. being employed.</p>

<p>From a Field Service Manual<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on "Posts and
Telegraphs," we have been able to glean a few details
respecting the organization and establishment of the
Indian military post offices. In times of peace a stock
of tents and equipment, sufficient for the supply of
three base post offices, fifty first-class field post offices,
ten second-class field post offices, and for the supervising
staff, is kept in store at Lahore in the charge of
the Postal Department of the Punjab.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Quoted from <i>Stamp Collecting</i>, December 5, 1914.</p></div>

<p>On the outbreak of war the military postal service
is organized by the Director-General of Posts and
Telegraphs in India according to the requirements of
the Army authorities.</p>

<p>The supervising staff is selected by him from a roll
of European volunteers for such service maintained in
his office, the full war establishment consisting of six
Directors or Deputy Directors, eighteen Assistant
Directors, twenty-four Inspectors, and fifty Postmasters.
The rest of the establishment is selected by
the Postmaster-General of the Punjab.</p>

<p>One Director or Deputy Director, two Assistant
Directors, and four Inspectors constitute the normal
postal personnel of an expeditionary force. They wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the ordinary field service uniform of the Indian Army
according to their respective ranks, distinguished by
the word "Post" on the shoulder straps.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the Indian Army
Order, No. 619, dated November 10, 1913, are of
interest:</p>

<blockquote><p>"7. The Director or Deputy Director, or, in his
absence, the Postmaster-General under whose orders
he is to work, should, on receipt of the first intimation
that a force is to be mobilized, take the earliest opportunity
to consult the General Officer appointed to
command the force as to the postal requirements of
the force in respect of the number of field post offices,
the classes of postal business to be undertaken, the
establishment to be provided, etc. As far as possible,
the wishes of the General Officer commanding should
be carried out.</p>

<p>"23. The Director-General will arrange that the
treasury nearest to the base office is supplied with about
ten times its normal supply of ordinary postage stamps
(including postcards and envelopes), and that a
sufficient stock is maintained throughout the campaign.
The base post office should thus be in a position to
supply at once the postage stamps required in field
post offices. If there is no treasury at hand, a sufficient
supply of postage stamps of all descriptions must be
kept at the base post office. The base post office will
be supplied with an iron safe, or two, if necessary.</p>

<p>"24. The requisite stamps, scales, bags, and other
articles of stock sufficient for six months' requirements,
will be furnished to the base post office for its own use,
and for distribution, under the orders of the Director<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
or Deputy Director, to field post offices. Section 5 B
shows the books, forms, stamps, etc., required for field
post offices. All books, forms, and articles of stock
should be packed in the prescribed mule trunks, each
of which, when packed, should not exceed one maund
in weight. The books, forms, and stamps required by
the base post office will be the same as those used by
a head office in India performing the same classes of
business; but in addition to the ordinary stamps it will
be supplied with a special 'postage cancelled' stamp."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another form of war stamp is the charity stamps;
these have been issued by various countries in order
to collect money for Red Cross and other funds. The
labels serve for ordinary postal work, but as a rule
cost a halfpenny or penny above face value. A charge
of three-halfpence, for instance, is made for a penny
stamp, a penny of the sum being appropriated by the
postal authorities, and a halfpenny being remitted to
the Red Cross Fund. So far, France, Monaco,
Belgium, Russia, Austria, and Hungary have printed
charity labels, and other countries have such issues in
contemplation. It may be mentioned that various
bogus charity stamps appearing to emanate from
Belgium have reached this country from Holland and
elsewhere; all such labels, therefore, should be
accepted with caution.</p>

<p>War stamps date back, at least, to the time of the
Crimea. In this campaign the British forces instituted
a military post office at Constantinople with
branch offices at Balaclava and Scutari. No special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
stamps were given to the soldiers, the current British
penny reds being used. The postmarks, however,
were distinctive, and it is therefore possible to distinguish
between the red labels used in the ordinary
way at home and those used by the Expeditionary
Force. The distinctive postmarks were:</p>

<p>1. A crown placed between two stars, with straight
bars above and below, the whole forming an oval.</p>

<p>2. A star placed between two noughts; then as
No. 1.</p>

<p>As few people know of this rare and interesting
form of obliteration, it is quite possible to come across
specimens when buying the penny reds in quantities for
reconstructing plates.</p>

<p>Other war stamps are&mdash;(1) The Alsace and Lorraine
issue, which was printed primarily for military use
during the Franco-German campaign; (2) the overprinted
issues of Peru, used during the occupation of
this republic by Chilian forces; (3) the Egyptian issue
overprinted with the word "Soudan," at the time
when Lord Kitchener was carrying on the Soudan
campaign; (4) the V.R.I. issues of the Transvaal;
(5) the Italian issues bearing the overprint "Lybia,"
current during the Italian-Turkish War; and (6) the
many issues which resulted from the Balkan War
of 1912.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, it may be well to
speak of the Spanish stamps of 1874-1879, and
1898-99, which bear the inscription, "Impuesto de
Guerra." These labels were not war stamps in the
ordinary sense, but stamps issued to collect a war-tax.
After the Carlist War, the insurrection of Cartagena,
the Civil War in Cuba, and the Spanish-American
War, the Government decided to impose a war-tax
upon a number of articles, such as letters, telegrams,
theatre tickets and railway tickets. The stamps bearing
the above inscription were therefore issued to facilitate
the collection of these taxes. When the used copies
have done postal duty they may be looked upon as
postage stamps, but collectors should avoid purchasing
specimens which served for theatre, railway, and the
various other uses.</p>

<p class="center">SOME FAMOUS COLLECTIONS</p>

<p>The ardent philatelist is not only interested in his
own collection, but is ever keen on inspecting those of
other people. A great treat, therefore, for the reader
who lives in London, or who is staying in the great
metropolis, is a visit to the British Museum, where the
famous Tapling Collection is stored. To find one's
way about the vast treasure-house in Bloomsbury is no
easy matter, but the stamp exhibits will be quickly
located if the visitor, on entering, takes the first public
turning to the right and then the first on the left.
The cases are placed about half-way down the King's
Library, on the right-hand side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The collection is housed in three separate cupboards,
and the stamps are arranged under glass in frames. It
may be well to add that the position is not a very good
one from the point of view of lighting, and, unless the
visitor goes during the brightest part of the day, he
will lose much of the enjoyment on this account.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say which are the most interesting
specimens in the collection, for nearly all the great
rarities are present. The issues of Great Britain, however,
are very complete, and should, therefore, be
examined with care. Not only are there copies of the
"penny blacks" and "twopenny blues," sufficient to
delight the heart of any very advanced collector, but
there are also copies of the most valuable early surface-printed
specimens. Some of the essays&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, stamps
made for purposes of trial&mdash;are extremely interesting.
These issues, naturally, do not fall into the ordinary
collector's possession, but here they are to be inspected
in hundreds. There are, for instance, about twenty-five
essays, in different colours, of the penny with
Queen Victoria's head, which was issued in lilac.
There are also countless specimens of the complete
1884 issue in various shades from crimson to blue,
whilst the tenpenny value of 1890 is shown in half
a dozen different combinations of colour. A very
curious essay to be seen here is a penny line-engraved
stamp bearing a profile of Prince Consort.
Apparently, this tentative label never received official
sanction, as the people of Great Britain might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
considered the innovation a slight to the Queen they
loved.</p>

<p>Among the entires of Great Britain there are many
long-forgotten treasures, such as the penny-farthing
postcard, the twopenny card, and the South Kensington
Jubilee cards.</p>

<p>Of colonial stamps there are some particularly complete
sets of early issues. The "Sydney Views" of
New South Wales are shown in whole panes of twenty-five,
the triangular Capes are given in numbers, whilst
the array of early Mauritius adhesives is not to be
surpassed. The postcards of Ceylon are also worthy
of mention.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that some of the greatest
rarities have been removed from the ordinary cases and
placed in the Cracherode Room, where, however, they
can still be viewed at leisure. The whole collection is
said to be worth £100,000, was bequeathed to the
Trustees of the Museum by the late Mr. T. K.
Tapling, M.P., and has been in their hands since 1891.
No stamps have been added to the collection since
it came into the Trustees' possession, so that specimens
of a later date are conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>Another fine collection of stamps is possessed by the
postal authorities in Newgate Street, but, unfortunately,
no facilities are given for public inspection. The
labels in this collection are in an unused condition,
and consist largely of the specimens which are sent
out by every country belonging to the Universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Postal Union. This collection also contains a number
of trial and "imprimatur" sheets of British stamps.</p>

<p>King George's collection is probably one of the most
interesting in the world. It is a private collection, and
therefore not on view; but sections of it, however, have
been exhibited from time to time. Mr. F. J. Melville,
who is well acquainted with its contents, tells us in
"Chats on Postage Stamps" (p. 312) that&mdash;</p>

<p>"The collection contains the original sketch of
W. Mulready, R.A., for the famous envelopes and
letter-sheets of 1840, to which reference has been
made. Then there is the historic pair of sketches
in water-colours, roughly executed by Sir Rowland Hill
to show the approximate appearance of the penny stamp
in black and the twopenny stamp in blue.</p>

<p>"Of the ordinary stamps of King Edward's reign,
the Royal collection contains several essays and proofs
of great interest. A photograph of a stamp made up
from Herr Füchs's original sketch of King Edward's
head, enclosed in the newly designed frame and border,
deservedly comes first, and bears the late King's written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
approval: from this, temporary copper-plates were
engraved so that the effect might be noted, and three
proofs therefrom are included. Unfortunately, the
final result did not come up to the anticipated standard,
and there was some talk about having a fresh design
prepared after the style of the then new Transvaal
stamps, but this fell through on the ground of expense;
proofs of this also are in the collection, together
with various colour-trials of the penny value, as
adopted."</p>

<p>The King's collection also contains specimens of&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
The unissued Tyrian-plum twopenny, Great
Britain; (<i>b</i>) Mauritius penny red, post office;
(<i>c</i>) British Guiana, many of the 1860-1862 issues;
(<i>d</i>) some very fine stamps of Nevis, Hongkong,
Grenada, Trinidad, and Bermuda.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
